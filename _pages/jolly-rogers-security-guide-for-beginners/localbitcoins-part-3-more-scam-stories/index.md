<p>just got robbed in Oklahoma City &#8211; Edmond, a kid about 20 years old, brownish-blonde hair, 6 ft tall, 150-160lbs</p>
<p>$950.00 &#8211;</p>
<p>be careful doing bitcoin trades.  I know it&#8217;s tough to get trust, so my advice is start small and after you have gained trust, make sure the money is in your pocket before you release the coins!!</p>
<p>I guess it is just the price to pay to learn a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>realestone:</strong><br/>
can you give more details what happened exactly?</p>
<p><strong>AmbysWorld:</strong></p>
<p>We met, inside a coffee shop, introduced myself, asked him if he had done trades before.  He said he had done several.  I wanted to make sure he was familiar with how the site worked and then to see if he had any questions about bitcoins in general.  I released the coins, and we started to shake hands as he was handing me the envelope.  He jerked the envelope out of my hand and took off running.</p>
<p>Every person I have met has been awesome and excited about bitcoins.  So I let my guard down.  Showed up wearing flip flops.  I started to pursue after he had already taken 3 steps, but then realized I would not be able to run in flippers for very long and stopped after about 100 yards.</p>
<p>The worst part is that I had my 14 year old daughter with me.  There is a special place in hell for people like this!</p>

<p>Here is a story from a group of people trying to test out LocalBitcoins for the first time and ended up losing their Bitcoins due to their own ignorance. But the buyer could have done the right thing, and did not.</p>

<blockquote><p>Bitcoin in hand, we decided to take a look at Localbitcoin and see how easy the system is for someone who does not know the lingo and does not have much experience with computers to see, what the difficulties could be.</p>
<p>So we found a buyer and proceeded to do an exchange of a small amount of Bitcoins. Everything looked great at first as we signed up, got verified and then proceeded to transact with the trader. We sent our Bitcoins and where confronted with some windows which began to confuse our tester, who mistakenly confirmed the transaction, minutes after sending the Bitcoins. Our tester was not sure if they needed to click the confirmation to advise the trader that the coins where sent, so spent some time in the FAQ to find out what to do next. No information was found by our tester, who then guessed that since there was no mention of it, then it must be a trivial issue and confirmed the transaction anyway. What happened next worried out tester as the transaction was marked as closed and they had sent the Bitcoins to the trader without knowing if the fiat money would be deposited into the bank account. We waited 24 hours to confirm a cash transaction into a designated account and lo and behold, its not there.</p>
<p>Next we proceeded to contact the trader and as of writing, we have not heard from them. We contacted Localbitcoin support and began a ticket. Shortly afterwards, we received an email from Localbitcoin support staff and explained the situation and where told that the confirmation did need to be done AFTER we confirmed the funds had been placed into our designated account by the trader.</p>
<p>After a few emails to the support staff, we did explain that we where testing the system useability for the everyday mom and pop situation, because if Bitcoin is to be used properly, it needs to have an easy (dumbed down) system so the inexperienced user can make a trade without making mistakes like our tester did.</p>

<p>This next one is an attempt at a phishing scam. A phishing scam is when somebody sends you to a URL that looks like the real URL, but it is actually set up so that when you login, it steals your login credentials and the attacker takes over your account. In this case, take over the LocalBitcoin account and steal the Bitcoin</p>

<blockquote><p>User requested nearly $2k CAD worth of bitcoins using my localbitcoins ad.</p>
<p>Immediately asked to move the conversation to text messaging, asked me “how many coins I have in there (localbitcoins wallet)” then (after some dawdling and chitchat) asked me to “check out and read his other localbitcoins ad first”.</p>
<p>Included was a URL to localbitcoinis.com with an ad url long enough I know this was copy/pasted and not a typo.</p>
<p>A quick WHOIS reveals a domain by proxy, but some google-fu on the contact telephone number registered to the domain reveals that domains related to this phone number have been involved in other scams.</p>

<p>Luckily for the seller, he did not fall for the scam. But anybody not careful enough could fall victim to this scam. Always make sure you read the url closely.</p>
