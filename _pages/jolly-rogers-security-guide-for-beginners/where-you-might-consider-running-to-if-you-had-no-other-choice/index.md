<p>In the case that you may have to run, here are some things to consider.</p>
<p>I am not an expert on evading extradition, or how to evade the federal government, NSA or other super powers, but I do have some recommendations that you might want to consider if you decide that you have no other choice but to run. The following countries do not currently have an extradition treaty to the United States.</p>

<p>Herzegovina, Brunei, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, the Central</p>
<p>African Republic, Chad, China, Comoros, Congo (Kinshasa), Congo (Brazzaville), Djibouti, Equatorial</p>

<p>This does not mean that these countries will not extradite you, but if you are going to pick a country to flee to, it would be favorable to your chance to choose from this list. One noteable country on this list, which is famous for extraditing one of the owners of the <strong>Pirate Bay, </strong> Gottfrid Svartholm to Sweden, is Cambodia. Although no treaty exists between the two countries, he was extradited by the government.</p>
<p>We all know that Edward Snowden fled to Russia from Hong Kong after leaving the US from Hawaii and has remained there since without being extradited by the government and was granted a 1 year temporary asylum. It is unclear if Snowden will be able to stay longer than his 1 year temporary asylum grants, but as of right now he is badly wanted by the US government, and Russia is refusing to hand him over.</p>
<p>Another person involved in the Pirate Bay named Fredrik Neij fled to Laos in Asia following being convicted of &#8220;assisting in making copyright content available&#8221; and was sentenced to one year in prison and ordered to pay damages of 30 million SEK (approximately €2,740,900 or US$3,620,000). This is of course between Laos and Sweden, but Laos has not extradited Fredrik, so Laos may be a valid option.</p>
<p>I often hear people from the US claim that if &#8220;shit ever pops off&#8221; they would just flee to Canada. Do not even try it, you would not even make it through the border. Canada is like the baby brother of the United States. When the United States says jump, Canada says &#8220;how high?&#8221;. Stay away from Canada if you are running from the United States. Even a pot activist named Mark Emery who was a Canadian citizen, lived in Canada, but sold marijuana seeds over the internet to people in the US was extradited to the US to serve a 5 year sentence. According to the other seed vendors in the area, those who only sold within Canada had never been arrested, but because Emery sold to the US, he was arrested and extradited. And of course, we know that Ireland and Australia will likely be extraditing two of the moderators from Silk Road to the United States soon enough.</p>
<p>Although not on the list above, a woman, wanted in the US for parental kidnapping, named Chere Lyn Tomayko was granted asylum in Costa Rica.</p>

<blockquote><p>Tomayko&#8217;s claims that her actions were justified by domestic violence she suffered were taken into account by the Costa Rican authorities.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Assata Shakur</strong> was charged with murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, bank robbery, and kidnapping by the US and fled to Cuba. Cuba actually has an extradition treaty with the US, but the relations between the two countries have not been good since the cold war between the US and the Soviet Union and thus the requests were not honored, even for someone with such serious charges. Cuba may be an option for you, but again this is only something to consider as I am no expert in any way.</p>
<p>And finally according to a previous post of mine explaining how the Secret Service sold fake IDs online to people on a forum, several of the members of that forum were able to evade capture due to being in Eastern European countries, although not specified by the feds for obvious reasons, and remain at large to this day.</p>

<blockquote><p>The government made its move in 2012, arresting dozens of fraudsters in the US and in countries where extradition is easy. But many more, including the founder of Cards.ru, remain at large. Those in Eastern European countries, especially, are largely out of the government&#8217;s reach.</p></blockquote>
