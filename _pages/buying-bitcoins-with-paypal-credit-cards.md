<p><strong>Paypal and Bitcoin Streamline the Online Purchasing Process<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Paypal is one of the most trusted and popular services for online transactions these days. Paypal is everywhere now, as many merchants and traders have adopted it with open arms.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is another method of conducting online transactions, which has carved out its own place in the market. Bitcoin is a decentralized, digital currency, with a fixed supply, that reduces the need for using physical or hard money.</p>
<p>On one hand, Paypal makes online, fiat transactions fast and easy. On the other hand, Bitcoin is both a currency and payment system that operates independently of the fiat monetary system, thereby making online purchases more like an equivalent of cash purchases in the real world—whereas Paypal is merely an intermediary between the Internet and a Physical bank.</p>
<p>The speed, security, and convenience of Bitcoin has of course created an ever-increasing demand for the digital currency. As a result, online Bitcoin exchanges—a popular avenue for buying and selling bitcoins—have popped up in droves.</p>
<p>However, one may ask the question: can I buy bitcoins using Paypal, so I do not have to directly link my bank account to a Bitcoin exchange? Yes, here&#8217;s how:</p>
<p><strong>Successfully Buying Bitcoins With Paypal<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Many people who have used Bitcoin and Paypal say that using Paypal to buy Bitcoin is a very difficult process. If we take a glance at the previous track record of buying Bitcoin via Paypal, we will see that people have indeed faced many inconveniences with Paypal. These difficulties arise due to recurring situations where a person uses Paypal to buy Bitcoin, and then initiates a chargeback, in which the person claims to never have received the bitcoins, and demands a refund from the Bitcoin seller. It is said that Paypal often favors fraudulent merchants, so most Bitcoin traders expect this system to be dangerous with a high chance of having their money stolen, and may opt to refrain from purchasing bitcoins through Paypal.</p>
<p>It is possible to successfully use paypal to buy bitcoins, though, and sell them for a higher prices through online marketplaces, such as LocalBitcoins and eBay. There are two methods that will allow one to buy bitcoins with Paypal: Virwox or credit cards. Virwox charges a commission fee for using its services, but it is, by far, easier to buy bitcoins through Paypal with Virox than by using a credit card. Therefore, we will show you how to use Virwox to successfully buy bitcoins through Paypal.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>After Clicking “Next,” you need to confirm your order.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/5-place-order.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1832" src="/imgs/2013/11/5-place-order.png" alt="5-place-order" width="675" height="226" srcset="/imgs/2013/11/5-place-order.png 1140w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/5-place-order-300x101.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/5-place-order-1024x343.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:  </strong>After you have converted your USD to SLL, all that is left to do is to convert the SLL to BTC. To do this, Just click on the “BTC/SLL” button on the sidebar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/6-convert-to-BTC.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1833" src="/imgs/2013/11/6-convert-to-BTC.png" alt="6-convert-to-BTC" width="833" height="335" srcset="/imgs/2013/11/6-convert-to-BTC.png 1459w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/6-convert-to-BTC-300x121.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/6-convert-to-BTC-1024x412.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 8:</strong> On the next screen, enter the mount of bitcoins you want to buy using your SLL.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/7-convert-to-BTC2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1834" src="/imgs/2013/11/7-convert-to-BTC2.png" alt="7-convert-to-BTC2" width="691" height="329" srcset="/imgs/2013/11/7-convert-to-BTC2.png 988w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/7-convert-to-BTC2-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> After your transaction has been confirmed, you will be able to withdraw your bitcoins and send them to your wallet; click the “Withdraw” button on the sidebar.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/8-withdraw.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1835" src="/imgs/2013/11/8-withdraw.png" alt="8-withdraw" width="721" height="425" srcset="/imgs/2013/11/8-withdraw.png 1027w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/8-withdraw-300x177.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/8-withdraw-1024x604.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 10: </strong>Enter the amount of bitcoins you want to Withdraw, then enter your Bitcoin address and click the “Request Withdraw” button. <strong>Note</strong>: on your first time there, may be a 48 hour delay until your bitcoins are sent to your wallet. This delay is placed to help prevent fraud. After your first transaction, though, the withdrawal will be instant, and it can be traced in the Blockchain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-withdraw-btc.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1836" src="/imgs/2013/11/9-withdraw-btc.png" alt="9-withdraw-btc" width="813" height="393" srcset="/imgs/2013/11/9-withdraw-btc.png 1208w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-withdraw-btc-300x145.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-withdraw-btc-1024x495.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" /></a></p>
<p>In conclusion, this method is the easiest way to buy bitcoins using paypal and credit cards; the only disadvantages are the fees (Papal fees, Lower rates for BTC &amp; SLL).</p>
