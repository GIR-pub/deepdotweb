<p>This page provides a short introduction and insight about DeepDotWeb.</p>
<p>Some of you may already know a lot about our website, but most of you probably don’t. Here are some things you should know about DeepDotWeb:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are a team that gathers information and educates the public on everything related to the dark net.</li>
<li>Not all of us are native English speakers, so we apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors in our posts and articles.</li>
<li>This site is a hobby of ours, our main business lies in internet assets.</li>
<li>We established DeepDotWeb in the wake of our friend being arrested by local authorities, for buying drugs from the original Silk Road marketplace. Our aim is make information about dark net markets accessible to everyone, as well as making the dark net safer by reporting on security risks, scams and operations conducted by law enforcement. By providing accurate and reliable information, we are able to accumulate a huge readership, reaching hundreds of thousands of unique visitors within the first 2 or 3 months of this site’s existence. Our success is the best possible and perfectly legal revenge we could have against the people who busted our friend.</li>
<li>We have extensive knowledge and experience with the different dark net communities we gather our information from. For example, we knew about the first Silk Road for almost 2 years before it was shut down.</li>
<li>We do not favour one market over another, the only thing we care about is what happens on in the various markets—the conduct of the buyers, sellers, administrators, moderators, and anyone else on every market. We strive to always maintain honest and accurate information; we do not wish to harm our readers by directing them to scam sites or by giving them false information.</li>
<li>We have helped journalists before and will happily do so again. So, if you think we can help with anything, do not hesitate to contact us. We will NEVER request money or lay out any conditions for our help. We provide our services for free and will continue to for as long as we are able. We are happy to publish work from journalists or anyone else that visits our site (for example, the Raoul Duke article we published for Christmas and a few tutorials written by people who gave us approval to publish their work). Additionally, we incentivize writers by paying for interesting content that our readers will be interested in.</li>
<li>We do not make money from this project! Yes, we do have some ads on the site to help pay for hosting costs and programming work. However, the time, effort, and money we put into this site costs us significantly more than we earn from the site. Not that this bothers us though, we do this because we enjoy it!</li>
<li>Our most popular page on the site is a list of <a href="/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">hidden marketplaces</a>.<br />
Please note that we will NEVER take any money to add, remove, or change the status of the sites on the list—every site gets the status it deserves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for visiting our site, we hope to continue providing reliable information about the dark net markets for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Be safe,<br />

<p>(This page was originally posted on the Silk Road 2.0 Forums as our “DeepDotWeb.com Introduction!” We liked it so much that we added it to the site as our official “About Us” page. The Silk Road 2.0 thread was here: http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=14634.0 &#8211; Before Silk Road 2 was <a title="Silk Road 2 Seized! (Multiple Markets Seized)" href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/11/06/silk-road-2-seized/">taken down</a>)</p>
