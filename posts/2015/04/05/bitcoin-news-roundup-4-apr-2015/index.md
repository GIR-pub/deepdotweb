    <p>Seemingly, Edward Snowden, an NSA ex-analyst, falls under this category after leaking confidential data on NSA surveillance activities. CoinTelegraph reported good willed bitcoiners ostensibly defying this order by donating 200 BTC to his public address <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/315vee/anonymous_donations_to_edward_snowden_point_your/">1snowqQP5VmZgU47i5AWwz9fsgHQg94Fa</a></p>
