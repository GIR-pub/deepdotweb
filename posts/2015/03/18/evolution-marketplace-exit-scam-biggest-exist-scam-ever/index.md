    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Estimated</span> Loss: 40,000+ BTC  (Around 12$ Million)<br />
    </strong></p>
    <p>Well, after posting yesterday about the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/evolution-marketplace">withdrawal issues</a> its pretty much confirmed now, the admins of <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/evolution-marketplace">Evolution marketplace</a>, the markets thats being regarded as the biggest market currently have been exit scamming and unless proven otherwise, are now gone with everyone&#8217;s funds in what appears to be the biggest exist scams in the darknet history since the <a title="Sheep Marketplace Scam: Over 40,000,000$ in the Biggest Darknet Scam Ever!" href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/11/30/sheep-marketplace-scammed-over-40000000-in-the-biggets-darknet-scam-ever/">sheep marketplace scam</a>. There is now to confirm at this time how much money was lost in the process (some unverified claims say around <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/03/18/evolution-market-scam-12-million-in-btc-lost/">12$ million</a>) but its pretty safe to assume its many millions of dollars in BTC.</p>
    <p>The market is now down and Evolution Staff member NSWGreat <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2zeuxo/complaintwarning_evolution_admins_exit_scamming/">posted this</a> on Reddit:</p>
    <blockquote><p>I hate to the bearer of bad news, but I&#8217;ve been suspicious the past few days with withdrawals not working and admins usually are more forth coming in explaining to me why they&#8217;re slow but they weren&#8217;t this time. Just kept giving me time-frames<br />
    I have admin access to see parts of the back end, the admins are preparing to exit scam with all the funds. Not a single withdrawal has gone through in almost a week. Automatic withdrawals has been disabled which is only doing on rare occasions</p>
    <p>I am so sorry, but Verto and Kimble have fucked us all. I have over $20,000 in escrow myself from sales.</p>
    <p>I can&#8217;t fucking believe it, absolute scum. I am giving this warning to you all as soon as I possibly could of.</p>
    <p>Confronted Kimble and Verto about it, they confirmed it and they&#8217;re doing it right now..</p>
    <p>EDIT: Servers have gone down, including back up server for staff. I&#8217;m sorry for everyone&#8217;s loses, I&#8217;m gutted and speechless. I feel so betrayed.</p></blockquote>
    <p>The forums are still up at this time (<strong>Edit</strong>: forums are down now). <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ScreenShot2015-03-17at6.01.27PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9503" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ScreenShot2015-03-17at6.01.27PM.png" alt="ScreenShot2015-03-17at6.01.27PM" width="997" height="673" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ScreenShot2015-03-17at6.01.27PM.png 997w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ScreenShot2015-03-17at6.01.27PM-300x203.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ScreenShot2015-03-17at6.01.27PM-290x195.png 290w" sizes="(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px" /></a></p>
