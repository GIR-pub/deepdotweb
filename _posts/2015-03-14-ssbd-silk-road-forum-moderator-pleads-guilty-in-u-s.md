<p>Peter Nash, 42, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to conspiracy to commit narcotics trafficking and money laundering, a month after a U.S. jury convicted the suspected mastermind behind Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Comments:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Gary Davis Please advise Mr. Serrin Turner that I am not &#8220;in custody in Ireland, awaiting extradition to the U.S. for prosecution&#8221;.</p>
<p>The United States government has not yet managed to make Ireland the 51st state, though it seems Mr. Turner believes otherwise.</p>
<p>That a known, material fact such as the actual legal status of one of the defendants named in the U.S. indictment is either being misrepresented or is seemingly entirely unknown to the prosecuting Assistant United States Attorney surely calls into question the legitimacy or strength of certain other material facts being presented to him to fight his case.</p></blockquote>
