<p>In order for the exploit to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has to have an active session open with Agora</li>
<li>Must have JS enabled</li>
<li>See an unknown link and be dumb enough to click on it while having have JS enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Solution</strong></span>: Don&#8217;t do any of the above. Especially if you are a vendor. And hopefully that Agora will fix their CSRF vulnerability at some point (its wan known for quite a while now).</p>
