<p>Well, this Basically:<br/>
    (We held back this report until now for the case it might be back, but considering the fact that the Admin were pretty active on the forums / Reddit, and we have yet to hear from them, it seems pretty unlikely to happen now)</p>

<p>The same story over again, for an traditional escrow marketplace:</p>
<p>1. Build reputation (let me remind that this market was not only a market but also a third party escrow service &#8211; so they had shit load of money in escrow, being an escrow service)</p>
<p>2. Grow (also, be very active on reddit / hub)</p>
<p>3. Say you are going to be an invite only market using some &#8220;web of trust&#8221; sign for users / vendors. (this one is actually unique for this particular market)</p>
<p>4. Get more users</p>
<p>5. Stop Withdrawals</p>
<p>6. Poof.</p>
<p>7. Have fun.</p>
<p>*8. Optional &#8211; Say you got hacked</p>
<p>Sorry for using the same picture for the millionth time.</p>

<p>Sorry for those who lost money, and hopefully this will not happen again (but it probably will).</p>
