<p>According to a new post made by <a href="#">
<blockquote><p>We reached <b>200,000 users</b> on the Marketplace just now. On behalf of the entire AlphaBay Staff, we thank you for your ongoing support, faith &amp; effort to shape AlphaBay as it is today &#8211; a top-grade black market!</p>
<p>With the help of our community, we will continue to do our best to run AlphaBay for many milestones ahead in a transparent way, accompanied by strong security practices &amp; blazing-fast marketplace speed.</p>
<p>Sincerely Thank You,<br />
    AlphaBay Staff</p></blockquote>
<p>The market have experienced a massive growth after <a href="/2015/08/26/agora-market-to-pause-operations-finish-your-orders-and-withdraw-money/">Agora was shut down</a> last month and following a <a href="#">Abraxas Market</a> for the &#8220;biggest market&#8221; title (this is mainly an assumption since we have no solid data about Abraxas user base, just internal site data about its popularity among our readers)</p>
<p>As far as we can remember &#8211; this is the first time that a market&#8217;s user count is being shared while the market is still active.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Alphabay Market admins and they have added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are happy to see new users who take advantage of the range of functionality we offer. One of the most successful initiatives, ScamWatch, has stopped several vendor exit scams, banned many scammers and continues to offer help to scam victims by processing refund requests from banned vendor balance (by providing the appropriate evidence of course) etc. We are currently working to introduce new exciting features and improvements both in marketplace &amp; forum to increase trust, security and functionality &#8211; coming soon.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></blockquote>
