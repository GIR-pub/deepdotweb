<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Following this <a href="/2015/03/27/breaking-sheep-marketplace-owner-arrested/">article</a>. Source of the info is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/karelb">/u/karleb</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/30k8d8/a_little_official_info_about_sheep_case_from/">this thread</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>I have found (with a help of a friend) a small additional info about Sheep case, from Czech Ministry of Finance&#8217;s Financial Analytical Office (FAÚ) annual report</p>
<p>FAÚ is a relatively new office that has the power to look to any Czech bank account instantly and follow the transaction without any further review.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty sweeping power and it has been controversial when it was established, but that&#8217;s beyond this post. They make annual reports, 2014 report was done on February 22 2015, and they mentioned alt currencies (not bitcoin by name, just &#8220;virtual currencies&#8221;) and Sheep Marketplace specifically (just nobody noticed it until now, not even newspapers or people from Czech Bitcoin community). The short note about SM doesn&#8217;t reveal much more than what was in the iHNed article, but I thought it&#8217;s worth translating &amp; putting in a new thread, since it&#8217;s more &#8220;official&#8221; than a news article.</p>
<p>I will translate the relevant part, <a href="http://www.mfcr.cz/assets/cs/media/Zprava_2014_Vyrocni-zprava-FAU-2014.pdf">full PDF (in Czech again) is here</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>FAÚ sometimes sees cases, where the interest of the offender is a virtual currency.</p>
<p>During inspection of a bank establishment we caught a international payment in behalf of a newly opened banking account of a person &#8220;EB&#8221;, which was sent by a certain company &#8220;BL&#8221;, that runs a virtual currency exchange in European Union and arranges trades with that cryptocurrency. During the investigation we found, that the payment is intended for a person &#8220;TJ&#8221;, a partner of a person &#8220;EB&#8221;. From the public sources we found out that the name &#8220;TJ&#8221; is mentioned in the context of theft of digital currency from the market &#8220;SM&#8221;. The operator of &#8220;SM&#8221; marketplace announced a security breach to server&#8217;s hosted accounts, and the theft of virtual currency. In the internet discussions there was mentioned, among other things, a suspicion, that the virtual money was taken by an anonymous operator of the marketplace, and as a possible suspect the name &#8220;TJ&#8221; is mentioned. In the investigation we detected more payments in hundreds of thousands and millions Czech Crowns that went to accoutns of &#8220;EB&#8221; and &#8220;TJ&#8221; and his father, from the company &#8220;BL&#8221;, that were designated among other things for buying real estate property. FAÚ filed a criminal complain for suspected crime of money laundering according to § 216 of the criminal code.</p>
<hr/>
<p>&#8220;EB&#8221; is code for Eva Bartošová, &#8220;TJ&#8221; for Tomáš Jiřikovský, &#8220;BL&#8221; for BitStamp Limited, &#8220;SM&#8221; for Sheep Market. They don&#8217;t say it specifically in the report, but well it&#8217;s kinda obvious.</p></blockquote>
