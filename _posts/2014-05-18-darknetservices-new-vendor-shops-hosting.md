<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is in no way a vouch for this service reliability or security, just a news update about its existence.  </strong></span></p>
<p>A new hosting services for DNM&#8217;s and vendor shop that just opened &#8211; seems to be running the most loved wordpress Woocommerce platform and hoping <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they will remove those calls to Google and host them locally!  (You know what i am talking about, do that.)</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is the general info provided on their site about this service:</span></p>
<blockquote>

We will provide all of our customers with the highest level of customer service and are more than willing to help point you in the correct direction to make your hidden service everything you need it to be.</p>
<p>for many people and businesses this can be a very important question. Most of the time you are looking for the service provider that stands out among the rest. Below I have outlines some areas that make Dark Net Services the place you would like to bring your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dedication to privacy and security.</li>
<li>High level of customer focus.</li>
<li>Advanced knowledge of networking and Tor.</li>
<li>Services do not share resources.</li>
<li>We don’t use only one server or server company.</li>
<li>Knowledge and ability to make your site everything you need it to be.</li>
<li>TRUST – We want to earn your money by providing a great service to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have secured servers all around the world and with many different companies. Even though we have taken all measures to ensure our servers will never bleed out their true ip address, we also randomly use secure vpn servers (set up by us) to create an encrypted connection and through them re route all incoming and outgoing traffic. This will limit the risk of site seizures and prevent authorities from being able to use vectoring as a method of  locating your hidden site.</p>
<p>We are here to do the things we love to do for the people that need it the most. In our terms of service we have outlined the things we find to be unexceptionable. We believe that everyone else should enjoy the same services as other vendors and businesses do on the clear net.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
