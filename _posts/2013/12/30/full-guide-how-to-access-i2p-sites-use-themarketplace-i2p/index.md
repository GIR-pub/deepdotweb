<p><b>The Marketplace</b> is conceptually pretty different from the other markets out there. Other darknet markets are basically giant online wallets into which buyers transfer Bitcoins before they go shopping. Once the buyer has received their goods, they permit the darknet market to release the funds to the seller who must then withdraw them. Once of the biggest disadvantages of this approach is that both the seller and buyer need to trust the darknet market to not:</p>
<ul>
<li>collapse; or</li>
<li>walk away with all the money stored on the platform</li>
</ul>
<p>for the duration of the transaction. When either of these eventualities occur, it can be very expensive and frustrating for both buyers and sellers. <b>TMP</b> goes some way to addressing these concerns using what’s called <b>multi-signature transactions</b>. <b>Multi-signature transactions</b> allow all the parties involved in handling the money (so that’s the buyer who is paying, the seller who is to be paid for the goods and the darknet market that wants their fee for providing a website to do all the business on), to always retain some control over the money for the duration of the order.</p>
<h3>An Order Overview</h3>
<p>To accomplish this, the buyer, the seller and the darknet market agree on a single use Bitcoin Address (the <i>Bitcoin Deposit Address</i>) into which the buyer will deposit the Bitcoins necessary to pay for their order. This agreement is reached by the repurposing of Bitcoin Addresses (the ones you are normally familiar with using to deposit your Bitcoins too), to act as keys to the agreed <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. Each participant (that’s the buyer, the seller and the darknet market) generate a Bitcoin Address which they use as a key to the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. For anyone to move any of the Bitcoins out of the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>, it requires that at least <b>two</b> of the key holders authorise it. Once a buyer has received their order, they will mark it as <b>Finalized</b> on the <b>TMP</b> website. <b>TMP</b> then effectively inserts their key (creates a transaction signed with their key) into the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> used for the order and asks the seller to do the same. Once the seller inserts their key (signs the transaction), the Bitcoins held in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> can be moved to the sellers nominated Bitcoin Address (E.g. a blockchain.info wallet, a BTC exchange etc) by broadcasting the signed transaction to the Bitcoin network. And that’s the magic. Unlike traditional darknet markets (Pandora, BlueSky etc), if <b>TMP</b> staff turned bad and wanted to steal the Bitcoins in a <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>, they would also need either the buyer or the seller for every in-progress order to also sign off. If none of the parties agree, the Bitcoins will just sit in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> for eternity but it also means that a buyer and a seller can get together completely outside of <b>TMP</b> and release any Bitcoins stored in <b>Bitcoin Deposit Addresses</b> to which they both hold the keys.</p>
<h3>TMP Service Fees</h3>
<p>Those who have been paying attention may be wondering where <b>TMP</b> receives its fee in all this? Well, when <b>TMP</b> creates the transaction that both it and the seller will sign to release the Bitcoins held in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>, the transaction contains two output Bitcoin Addresses. One is the sellers nominated Bitcoin Address and a second is a Bitcoin Address owned by <b>TMP</b> which is where their fee goes. The transaction that <b>TMP</b> creates and asks the seller to sign can be decoded and inspected to check the proportion of Bitcoins they’ve allocated to themselves from the Bitcoins held in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> before sign-off. Once the seller is happy, signs off and broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin network, everything is final and each party gets their share of the Bitcoins stored in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>.</p>
<h3>Declined Orders &amp; Order Cancellations</h3>
<p>When a buyer cancels an order that’s in progress or an order is declined by a seller (E.g. no stock etc), the process is the same as that of a seller signing off except that in this instance it is the buyer who signs-off to release the Bitcoins stored in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. <b>TMP</b> will ask the buyer to provide a Bitcoin Address they want their refund sent too, and then automatically create and sign the transaction (insert their key). The transaction is then passed to the buyer, who then signs off (inserts their key) and broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin network.</p>
<h3>Order Disputes</h3>
<p>Finally, in the unfortunate scenario where a buyer and a seller enter into a dispute (all toys out of the pram), <b>TMP</b> will propose a solution (For example; 50% of the Bitcoins held in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> to the buyer, and 50% to the seller). Provided at least the buyer *or* the seller agree to this, <b>TMP</b> will then sign the transaction and submit it to either the buyer or the seller for sign-off and broadcasting to the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoins will then be distributed as agreed.</p>
<h3>What if The Marketplace disappears?</h3>
<p>The beauty of <b>TMP</b> is that they are not required to release Bitcoins stored in <b>Bitcoin Deposit Addresses</b> provided the buyer and the seller can get in contact with each other and agree on a transaction. It may therefore be a good idea for buyers and sellers participating in regular or large transactions to provide alternative contact details for each other so that in the event of a service outage, any outstanding orders can be finalized and the Bitcoins released. <b>Note:</b> In this instance either the buyer or the seller would need to create and sign a transaction which the opposite party (buyer or seller) would also need to sign-off on. Either party could then broadcast the signed transaction to the Bitcoin network. Creating a raw transaction to finalize without <b>TMP</b> is covered in this section of the guide: <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p/#whatif">Finalising transactions outside of The Marketplace</a>. You may also (if you are technically minded) want to read up on raw transactions and that information can be found here: <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Raw_Transactions">Raw Transactions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installation-win">For Windows</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Double click the I2P software installer (i2pinstall_0.9.9_windows.exe)</li>
<li>Press <b>[Next]</b> until you reach the pack installation choice window</li>
<li><a href="/imgs/2014/01/11.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3214" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/11.png" alt="1" width="590" height="356" /> </a></li>
<li>The default option <b>Base</b> will be checked, but you also have the option of installing I2P as a <b>Windows Service</b>. This means it will automatically run in the background whenever you start your computer and you will always be participating in the I2P network. If you intend to be a frequent user, you may wish to consider this option for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>A) Everyone who uses I2P provides routing services and bandwidth for everyone else – e.g. in the same was as you upload a torrent when you’re not downloading to help others, if you are always connected to I2P you help make the network faster for everyone else.</li>
<li>B) Plausible deniability. If you are always connected to I2P, regardless of whether you are using it, your traffic cannot be so easily categorised as unique by malicious entities. For example, in the recent <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/failing-grade-alleged-harvard-bomb-hoaxer-needed-more-tor-cover-2D11767028">Harvard Bombscare</a> the perpetrator was caught because Law Enforcement worked out how many unique users were on the TOR network at the time, and paid each one of them a visit. The perpetrator had only logged on to TOR briefly during the period identified by LE, and therefore stuck a huge red flag on himself. If you are always connected to I2P, it would be significantly more difficult to accuse you of using it for less than legal purposes…assuming you did, which of course you wouldn’t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Press <b>[Next]</b> through all the remaining steps and <b>[Done]</b> once the software has installed <a href="/imgs/2014/01/22.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3225" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/22.png" alt="2" width="590" height="356" /> </a></li>
<li>If you have opted to install I2P as a <b>Windows Service</b> you will stop the service for the purposes of this tutorial. This ensures you can check for errors. If you have <b>not</b> opted to install as a <b>Windows Service</b>, skip to the next step.
<ul>
<li>A) <b>Start</b>-&gt;<b>Run</b>-&gt;type: <b>services.msc</b> and press <b>[Enter]</b></li>
<li>B) Scroll down until you find <b>I2P Service</b></li>
<li>C) Right click and select <b>Stop</b></li>
<li>D) Close the Services window</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <b>Start</b> and navigate to <b>I2P</b> shortcuts menu and click <b>Start I2P (restartable)</b>. The I2P software will now start.</li>
<li>You will be presented with the I2P command box:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/3.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-3226" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/31.png" alt="3" width="674" height="340" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>followed shortly by your default browser opening with the I2P web interface:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/41.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3238" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/41.png" alt="4" width="800" height="800" /> </a></p>
<p>7-At this point it takes I2P several minutes to initialise and find the necessary connections to other participants in the network. Click the I2P logo in the top left hand corner (market in red in the screenshot below) to change the management bar to reflect the details of your I2P connection. You may need to click twice before the full management view is visible.</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/51.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3239" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/51.png" alt="5" width="206" height="907" /> </a></p>
<p>Once the management bar is visible look down and once you see <b>Network: OK</b> (in the green box in the above screenshot), you are connected to the I2P network. The lower box that says “Rejecting tunnels: starting up” will eventually change to “Accepting tunnels”. You can optionally wait for this stage if you want to ensure you are a full participant in the I2P network. It can take about 30 minutes. 8. Now that I2P has loaded, you need to configure your browser in order to access the marketplace. As indicated in the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#prerequisites">pre-requisites</a>, we’ll be using <b>Mozilla Firefox</b>. The next stage is therefore to install <b>Mozilla Firefox</b> and the <b>QuickJS</b> and <b>FoxyProxy</b> extensions. 9. Once you have installed <b>Mozilla Firefox</b> and the extensions, you should see two new icons in the browser: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/61.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3240" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/61.png" alt="6" width="1011" height="80" /> </a> 10. Click the <b>FoxyProxy</b> icon to bring up the configuration window: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/7.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3242" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/71.png" alt="7" width="721" height="465" /> </a></p>
<p>Ensure the window looks like the screenshot above and select <b>Add New Proxy</b> from the menu on the left side. When the <b>Proxy Settings</b> window is displayed, choose the <b>Proxy Details</b> tab and enter <b>127.0.0.1</b> in the <b>Host or IP Address</b> box and <b>4444</b> in the <b>Port</b> box: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/8.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3243" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/8.png" alt="8" width="820" height="647" /> </a></p>
<p>Click the <b>URL Patterns</b> tab and click <b>Add New Pattern</b>. Choose a <b>Pattern Name</b> of <b>I2P</b> and in the <b>URL pattern</b> box enter <b>*.i2p*</b>. Click <b>[OK]</b>. <a href="/imgs/2014/01/9.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3244" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/9.png" alt="9" width="489" height="315" /> </a></p>
<p>Click <b>[OK]</b> to return to the configuration window. It should now look like this: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/10.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3245" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/10.png" alt="10" width="721" height="465" /> </a></p>
<p>Click <b>[Close]</b>.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are now configured to connect your <b>Mozilla Firefox</b> browser to I2P. The penultimate stage is to check that JavaScript is disabled. The <b>QuickJS</b> icon should be clicked until it represents a broken wheel (hovering over will show that this is JavaScript disabled mode):</li>
<li>In the address bar of <b>Mozilla Firefox</b> enter <b>http://themarketplace.i2p</b> – The I2P network will then wander off to try and route your connection. It is likely that you will receive a window saying <b>Warning Eepsite Not Found in Addressbook</b>. When this appears, click the <b>stats.i2p jump service</b> link.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/11.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3247" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/111.png" alt="11" width="1018" height="870" /> </a> When this returns, you should receive a <b>Success</b> window like the one below. <a href="/imgs/2014/01/12.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-3248" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/121.png" alt="12" width="1018" height="870" /> </a> You will be automatically directed to save the address to your router configuration (see screenshot below), when this window displays choose <b>Save themarketplace.i2p to router address book and continue to eepsite</b>. It may take several attempts to get this process to happen. You only need to do this once though, when you navigate to <b>http://themarketplace.i2p</b> in future, it should route you directly. <a href="/imgs/2014/01/13.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3249" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/141.png" alt="14" width="1006" height="520" /> </a> Finally, you will reach your goal – <b>The Market Place</b>…</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/14.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3250" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/151.png" alt="15" width="673" height="651" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <b>[Register]</b> button to begin the registration process. As part of this process you will need to supply a PGP encryption key. This ensures that all correspondence between you and any other vendors of the site is encrypted. If you have already got a PGP public key, you can paste it in here and skip past the following steps, if not – you need to install the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#prerequisites">GPG4Win 2.2.1</a> package listed in the prerequisites and follow the instructions below to create your key.</li>
<li>Install the GPG4Win 2.2.1 package – as part of this process <b>ensure you check the box to install GPA</b>, and once installed select <b>Start</b>-&gt;<b>GPA</b> icon from the start menu. This will launch the GNU Privacy Assistant which you will use to encrypt and decrypt any communications and generate your initial PGP public key.</li>
<li>When GPA starts for the first time it will ask you if you wish to <b>Generate a Key</b> or <b>Do it Later</b>. Choose <b>Do it Later</b> and navigate to <b>Keys</b> menu and choose <b>New key…</b>.</li>

<ol>
<li>Click <b>[Forward]</b> and enter a fake email address of {THE-MARKETPLACE-USERNAME}@themarketplace.i2p, E.g. <b><a class="__cf_email__" href="http://www.cloudflare.com/email-protection" data-cfemail="c6b2abb6b2a3b5b2a7a5a5a9b3a8b286b2aea3aba7b4ada3b2b6aaa7a5a3e8aff4b6">[email protected]</a><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[

<li>At this stage you can optionally create a backup of your key. This is recommended and you should store the backup on a secure USB stick that only you have access to. This means if you encounter a hardware failure or other problem, you can always decrypt communications for your The Marketplace account, especially important if you’re a vendor. Click <b>[Forward]</b></li>
<li>Finally, you will be prompted for a passphrase. Ensure its a memorable, strong password – you will need to use it every-time you want to decrypt a communication.</li>
<li>You’ve now created the keys you need for your <b>The Marketplace</b> registration, now to export the keys. Right click your new key and select <b>Export Keys…</b> from the menu</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/16.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3253" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/17.png" alt="16" width="696" height="638" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>You will be prompted to save the public portion of your key (this is the bit you can circulate to anyone so they can encrypt communications for you) to a file. Choose a location on your hard disk E.g. c:\temp\tmp\mypubkey.txt</li>
<li>Start <b>Notepad</b> (or your favourite text editor) and open the newly saved public key file. Copy the text content from the file into the <b>The Marketplace</b> registration form and complete the registration process.</li>
<li id="checkout">You will now be logged in. Click the <b>Products</b> link from the menu bar and shop for some legal, medicinal remedies. Once you’ve chosen, lets cover how you actually pay for your item… Navigate to your cart and click the <b>[Checkout]</b> button</li>

<p>Your order will now be created and require payment. <b>The Marketplace</b> is unique in that it requires multi-signature transactions, which basically means that you, the vendor and TMP Staff all have keys to your transaction, <b>but</b> in order for any one person to claim it, two of you have to agree. This ensures that the TMP staff can’t walk away with your (or the vendors) money. It would require either collusion between the TMP staff and the vendor, or yourself – either way, the potential damage is limited. On the screen under <b>Order requires payment</b> choose <b>Please click here to create the escrow address</b> <a href="/imgs/2014/01/18.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3255" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/19.png" alt="18" width="914" height="349" /> </a></p>
<p>You will now be requested to enter the <b>Public Key</b> that will be used to create the new wallet to which you will send funds. The terminology says “wallet”, but what it actually means is: “create a new Bitcoin Deposit Address that is unique to this order and to which you will pay your Bitcoins”. Each order will involve creating a different Bitcoin Address, unique to that order into which you will deposit your cash to pay for your order. <a href="/imgs/2014/01/19.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-3256" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/20.png" alt="19" width="905" height="322" /> </a></p>
<p>When you are presented with the <b>Create escrow address</b> window, you need to create a Public Key which is used – along with the vendor and TMP Staff’s public keys – to create a unique Bitcoin Address into which you will deposit your money to pay for your goods. This sounds confusing, but what you are basically doing is providing your part of the key in this multi-signature transaction. So, to do this you need to generate a public key. Navigate to <a href="https://www.bitaddress.org/">https://www.bitaddress.org/</a> to generate a new Bitcoin Address (<b>NOTE:</b> This Bitcoin Address is nothing to do with your order, it’s just an easy way to generate a public and private key. So don’t accidentally deposit funds to it). Once you generated your Bitcoin Address, it should look something like this: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/20.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-3257" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/211.png" alt="20" width="1041" height="334" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li id="buyerkey">The only bit you are interested in is the <b>Private Key</b>. Copy the <b>Private key</b> value into a text file somewhere and keep it safe <b>DONT LOSE IT</b>. You will need it to authorise or finalise the order or in the case of a dispute.</li>
<li>Now you need to get the Public Key. On <a href="https://www.bitaddress.org/">https://www.bitaddress.org/</a> copy the Private Key to your clipboard and click the <b>Wallet Details</b> tab. Here, enter the Private Key and click the <b>[View Details]</b> button.</li>

<p>Send the exact amount required to this address using the Bitcoin QT client (or Electrum if you are using it) and record the transaction ID. To do this, open Bitcoin-QT and click the <b>[Send]</b> button. Copy the details carefully from <b>The Marketplace</b> order window and send the required funds. You can use the <b>Label:</b> field if you are using Bicoin-QT to record the Private Key you generated in Step 24 for your order (it’s only visible to you). This makes it easier to find the key you need in the event of a refund you need to claim. The format <b>{FRIENDLY-LABEL}</b> – PRIV KEY: <b>{REPURPOSED-BTC-ADDRESS-PRIVATE-KEY}</b> ADDRESS: <b>{REPURPOSED-BTC-ADDRESS}</b> works well.</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/24.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3261" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/25.png" alt="24" width="819" height="224" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>Once the funds have been sent, you need to retrieve the transaction id so that <b>The Marketplace</b> knows that you’ve paid. In Bitcoin-QT, click the <b>[Transactions]</b> button, simply highlight the recent transaction you’ve just made, right click and select <b>Copy transaction id</b>. The transaction will be copied to your clipboard.</li>
<li>Return to <b>The Marketplace</b> and paste the transaction ID into the box and click <b>[Record transaction]</b>. <b>Note:</b> Ensure you strip off the “-000″ that Bitcoin-QT appends so for example: <b>8512e2728ca2153be0809d1252ecd8dfc6833a53fbfe1f8ba6f64ae19eaed663-000</b> you remove the <b>-000</b> so it’s just <b>8512e2728ca2153be0809d1252ecd8dfc6833a53fbfe1f8ba6f64ae19eaed663</b> before clicking <b>[Record transaction]</b>.</li>

<p><b>The Marketplace</b> will now take over and monitor the transaction. Once it reaches the required number of confirmations, it will be forwarded to the vendor for processing. Note: You can cancel the transaction even after it has been paid but before it has been passed to the vendor. For more information on refunds and how to claim one, see the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#refunds">Refunds</a> section. But we’re not done quite yet! Finally, you need to set your address so the vendor knows when to send your order. Click the <b>[Set Address]</b> button.</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/26.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-3265" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/27.png" alt="26" width="888" height="122" /> </a></p>
<p><b></b>You now need to encrypt your delivery address, and send it to the vendor. In the top right hand of the screen, click the <b>[View vendors PGP Key]</b> <a href="/imgs/2014/01/27.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3266" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/28.png" alt="27" width="898" height="389" /> </a></p>
<p>A new window will open and inside will be the vendors PGP public key, which you use if you want to send them any correspondence. Copy the text contents of this window to your clipboard, open Notepad (or your favourite text editor), paste it in and save the file to somewhere on your hard-disk, E.g.

<ol>
<li>You can close the browser tab once you’ve saved the key. Just keep the tab that requires your delivery address open.</li>
<li>Now to import the vendors key into GPA. Click <b>Start</b>-&gt;<b>GPA</b> icon from your start-menu to start <b>GNU Privacy Assistant</b>.</li>
<li>Click the <b>[Import]</b> button on the toolbar, and navigate to where you saved the vendors public key you just copied from your browser. The key will be imported and you should see it listed:</li>

<p>Each vendor will have their own key. This ensures that if <b>The Marketplace</b> is ever breached, any communications intercepted between vendors and buyers are effectively unreadable. Click the <b>Clipboard</b> button. The <b>GNU Privacy Assistant – Clipboard</b> is where you encrypt any communications to vendors and decrypt any communications in messages sent to you.

<p>Once you have entered it, click the <b>[Encrypt]</b> button and choose the vendors key. The text will be replaced by the encrypted version which can only be decrypted by the intended recipient (your vendor in this case).</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/31.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3270" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/32.png" alt="31" width="656" height="518" /> </a></p>
<p>Copy this encrypted text to your clipboard and paste it into <b>The Marketplace</b> <b>Update address</b> window and click <b>[Submit]</b>. <a href="/imgs/2014/01/32.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3271" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/33.png" alt="32" width="745" height="393" /> </a></p>
<p>That’s it, your order is now with the vendor. In due course you should receive your order. When you do, you need to login to the site to finalize: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/33.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-3272" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/34.png" alt="33" width="969" height="395" /> </a></p>
<p>You will now be prompted to leave a review (which you should do for the benefit of other potential customers) and the order life-cycle is complete. If you were unfortunate enough not to receive your order, or have another issue with the buyer, you can open a <b>Dispute</b>. This is covered elsewhere in this guide.</p>
<p>Refunds are the mechanism used by <b>TMP</b> to return Bitcoins to a buyer who has:</p>
<ul>
<li>paid for an order but decided to cancel it; or</li>
<li>had a paid order cancelled by a seller</li>
</ul>
<p>For any order that has been paid but that has not been Approved by the seller, the buyer will be able to claim a refund. Lets cover the process step-by-step from the buyers perspective. <b>NOTE:</b> If you are experimenting to understand the refund process, you will need to use some Bitcoins (the process isn’t risk free). If you are a seller, you can create and purchase one of your own products (See <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p/#selling">Selling</a> for more information). If you are just an average, curious buyer – find a suitable cheap product from a listed vendor and just <b>[Cancel]</b> the transaction as soon as you have paid for it. Create an order on <b>TMP</b> by following <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p/#checkout">Steps 21 to 35 inclusive</a> of the buyers guide. Immediately after making payment and recording the transaction ID, your order screen should look something like this: You will now be prompted to leave a review (which you should do for the benefit of other potential customers) and the order life-cycle is complete.

<h2 id="installation-tails">For TAILS (Linux) With Electrum</h2>
<p>This section covers the setup of the TAILS Secure Linux distribution along with installing the Electrum Bitcoin wallet and the <b>TMP</b> Electrum plugin.<br />
    We&#8217;ll also be covering how to use some of the options<br />
    provided by the <b>TMP</b> Electrum plugin, including; bulk seller key generation to create a large number of order keys quickly, creating a key (as a buyer) for Refunds and importing transactions (Refunds or Payment Retrival) from<br />
<b>TMP</b> for signing (inserting <i>your</i> key as either the buyer or the seller) and broadcast to the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of using TAILS is that it allows you to segregate your darknet activities from your main operating system (OS), however by design TAILS is forgetful. That means that every-time you reboot it, it&#8217;s as if<br />
    you never used it. Any data that you created (PGP keys, wallets, installed applications etc) during your previous use of TAILS is lost. To remedy this, the TAILS OS provides the ability to configure <i>persistent storage</i>. Persistent storage<br />
    reserves a bit of space on your USB or SD Card to allow configuration files and data to carry over between each reboot. In order to configure persistence, you need to do it from <b>within</b> the TAILS operating system.</p>
<p>Before we begin, you will need a blank DVD and a USB or SD Card available. You will use the DVD to get the TAILS running and then you will use the USB or SD Card to create a new installation of TAILS that has persistent storage enabled.<br />
    This is all covered in detail below.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you are running virtualisation software such as <a href="http://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation/">VMWare Workstation (Windows)</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/uk/products/fusion/">VMWare Fusion (Mac)</a> or <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> on your computer, you can use this<br />
    in place of the blank DVD to get TAILS initially started. You can also opt to use a <b>second</b> USB stick or SD Card in place of the DVD &#8211; installation instructions are provided here: <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/installation/manual/index.en.html">Manually installing TAILS onto a USB Stick or SD card</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li id="tails-s1">Download the TAILS iso image from the TAILS website: <a href="https://tails.boum.org/download/#index2h1">https://tails.boum.org/download/#index2h1</a> and save it somewhere on your hard-disk (E.g. c:\temp\tails-i386-0.22.iso)</li>
<li>Insert the blank DVD, locate the TAILS iso image (E.g. c:\temp\tails-i386-0.22.iso) and burn it to your DVD. You should use a competent burning program for this task such as <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download">ImgBurn</a>.</li>
<li>Reboot your computer with the freshly cooked DVD in your DVD drive to start TAILS. Remember; you will need to configure your PC to boot from the DVD drive if it doesn&#8217;t automatically &#8211; you can find these options in the BIOS (usually a frantic tapping of the <b>[F12]</b> or <b>[DEL]</b> keys when you first switch on your computer).</li>
<li id="tails-s4">TAILS should boot and you will be presented with a screen shown below:<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3273" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/35.png" alt="34" width="768" height="576" />Choose click <b>[Forward]</b></li>
<li>Now Tails will load and you can run the installer to install Tails to your USB flash drive. Be warned that many modern Apple computers will not boot Tails from USB without some special tricks.</li>
<li>The next step is to create a copy of TAILS with persistent storage enabled. Remember; TAILS forgets everything between reboots, so you need the ability to persist important data so you don&#8217;t have to re-enter it every-time.<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/opentailsinstaller.png" alt="" />When the <b>Tails installer</b> window displays, insert your USB stick or SD Card into your PC and choose <b>[Clone] &amp; Install</b></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/tailsinstallerinitialscreen.png" alt="" /></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Your USB Drive or SD Card should be listed in the drop-down box. If you have multiple USB devices or SD Cards connected, select the correct one and click <b>[Install Tails]</b>. Remember; you will lose everything on the USB stick or SD Card, so if you are in any doubt which USB or SD Card is the correct one,<br />
    remove all except the one you are going to use to install TAILS <i>with persistent storage</i> onto.<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3281" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/40-300x290.png" alt="39" width="300" height="290" /></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When the process is finished, you should receive a confirmation dialog. Your portable, persistent storage-able (but not enabled yet) TAILS installation is now ready.<a href="/imgs/2014/01/40.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-3282" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/411-300x262.png" alt="40" width="300" height="262" /><br />
</a>Reboot the system using the leaving the USB stick or SD card in place. If your PC is not set to boot from an SD Card or USB stick, you will need to enter the BIOS as you did in <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#tails-s1">Step 1</a>. Refer to your motherboard manufacturers guide if you are in any doubt about how to do this.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/reboottails.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Once your PC has restarted, you want to this time select &#8216;Yes&#8217; for additional options and enter a root password. Normally you do not want root enabled, but we will need it to set up some persistence settings. We now need to create the persistent storage volume. This tells TAILS what you want to allow to persist between reboots and that you want to reserve a bit of space on the USB stick or SD card to store all this information.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the &#8216;Configure persistent volume&#8217; in the Application menu. Remember; it&#8217;s protecting the evidence (not that you&#8217;ve anything to hide&#8230;) so don&#8217;t pick a password you&#8217;ve used anywhere else (Facebook, Gmail etc), make it strong and <b>don&#8217;t forget it!</b> (There is no recovery if you do).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3285" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/44.png" alt="43" width="531" height="592" /></p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve chosen, click the <b>[Create]</b> button.</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to keep as little as possible around, but you want at least &#8216;Personal Data&#8217;, GnuPG, and Dotfiles. Browser bookmarks may be good if you&#8217;re not good at remembering, but you can store important websites in another way that&#8217;s a bit more safe.<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/setuppersist1.png" alt="" /><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/setuppersist2.png" alt="" />
<p>Click the <b>[Save]</b> button to commit your changes.</li>
<li>Now we are going to make i2p a little quicker for us, since we will be using it to access the site. There should be a i2p preset in the prior screens in a future version of Tails, but for now we will have to manually do it. Go to <b>Applications</b> -&gt; <b>Accessories</b> -&gt; <b>Root Terminal</b> and enter the admin password when prompted. Then run the following to edit the persistence configuration files, remeber to hit Ctrl-O to save the changes to your file when you&#8217;ve added the extra line at the end.<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/addi2ppersist.png" alt="" /><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/addi2ppersist2.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Your persisted volume is now configured, but not yet enabled. You need to reboot to make the changes permanent. Select <b>System</b>-&gt;<b>Administration</b>-&gt;<b>Reboot</b> to restart.</li>
<li id="tails-s14">When TAILS has restarted, you&#8217;ll be presented with a different login screen to the one you&#8217;re used to:<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3287" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/46.png" alt="45" width="387" height="316" />Under <i>Use persistence?</i> choose <b>[Yes]</b> and in the <b>Passphrase</b> box, enter the password to your persist volume that you entered in <b>Step 11</b>. Leave the <b>Read-Only?</b> box <b>unchecked</b>. Do not click on &#8216;More options&#8217;. You will not need to enable it except for rare situations.</li>
<li id="tails-s16">Now we want to start installing some sorftware for use with The Marketplace. Before we start on this, we want to start up the I2P router so that it has time to get itself running before we actually need to access the any eepSites.<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/Screenshotopeni2p.png" alt="" />Ignore the router window or minimize it when it opens up. Now we will want to open Iceweasel, (it&#8217;s the globe icon right next to <b>System</b>, and go to <a> and get the latest version of Electrum.

<li>We want to set up scripts to start up Electrum correctly. We want to make sure it always connects to the correct servers and that we keep our escrow address keeps seperate from our cash handling keys. You can modify the &#8216;electrum.desktop&#8217; file to save a script to run Electrum for monies.<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/realcashwalletconfig.png" alt="" /><br />
    Modify the file silghtly again and save as a newfile, one for a wallet that onlydoes key storage and signing for you.<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/escrowwalletconfig.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Now we install the plugin file. In order to download it, first you&#8217;ll heve to register for for the forums. You want to at the very least use no password twice. Luckliy Tails comes with a password manager built in.<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/openkeeppassx.png" alt="" />Create a new password database. Be sure to pick a very strong password to use to keep all your passwords in. If you lose this, you&#8217;ll likely not ever be able toget back into your accounts.

    By now I2P should&#8217;ve had time to get ready for use. Disable Javacript on your browser, then head over to </a><a href="http://themarketplace.i2p/">http://themarketplace.i2p</a>.<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/disablejs.png" alt="" />You are likely going to get an error message becasue your router doesn&#8217;t know how to get to the market yet. Pick the stats.i2p jump service link, then select the open to save the domain to the counter and continue on.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/loginscreen.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We will go to the forum first to pick up the add-on. Fill out the registration info in the registration link. Since you don&#8217;t know (or care) whan gibberish your password is, you can easy right click on the account in KeePassX to copy the password into the clipboard so you can paste it in the correct field. Then navigate to the plugin thread and download the latest copy.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/saveplugin.png" alt="" /></p>

<li>We now need to set up our electrum wallet files. First we need to make our scripts we made runnable.<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/changeprops1.png" alt="" /><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/changeprops2.png" alt="" />
<p>You now want to run each one of the startup scripts to create two wallets. Remember, if you need a password, be sure to generate a fresh one in KeePassX and <b>save</b> the password after creation.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/askingpassword.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/safepasswords.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s extremely important to save your electrum seed words for each wallet. With your seed words you can recover every non-importated transaction in the wallet. Without it, you can be in a very bad spot. Save them seperately in a secure location.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/saveyourseed.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Then you can load the TMP plugin.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/loadtmpplugin.png" alt="" /></li>
<li>Now you want to close both copies of electrum and save your electrum&#8217;s peristence. This allows it to remembber what transactions you have made, and also allows it to keep the blockchain headers which will decrease network use. Then run this command<img src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/tmpguide/saveelectrumprefs.png" alt="" /></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, to round of this exercise, lets shutdown and check that all the hard work has been persisted. Now you want to exit electrum and reinter it without the admin password or additional options being enabled.</li>
<li>If everything has persisted correctly, Electrum will now start synchronizing and you&#8217;ll find your Bitcoin Addresses (order keys / transactions etc) will have been preserved.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional information on PGP key management and detail on the <b>TMP</b> plugin will follow in subsequent versions of this guide (hopefully).</p>
<p>Final note: there is probably a great deal more integration and optimization that can be done and you should not interpret this as the defacto guide to best practice &#8211; the author is not an expert. It should get you up and running<br />
    with a degree of security and once you are happy, you can begin experimenting with the additional functionality afforded by TAILS.</p>
<p>Refunds are the mechanism used by <b>TMP</b> to return Bitcoins to a buyer who has:</p>
<ul>
<li>paid for an order but decided to cancel it; or</li>
<li>had a paid order cancelled by a seller</li>
</ul>
<p>For any order that has been paid but that has not been Approved by the seller, the buyer will be able to claim a refund. Lets cover the process step-by-step from the buyers perspective. <b>NOTE:</b> If you are experimenting to understand the refund process, you will need to use some Bitcoins (the process isn’t risk free). If you are a seller, you can create and purchase one of your own products (See <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#selling">Selling</a> for more information). If you are just an average, curious buyer – find a suitable cheap product from a listed vendor and just <b>[Cancel]</b> the transaction as soon as you have paid for it. Create an order on <b>TMP</b> by following <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#checkout">Steps 21 to 35 inclusive</a> of the buyers guide. Immediately after making payment and recording the transaction ID, your order screen should look something like this: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/711.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3315" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/711.png" alt="71" width="968" height="493" /> </a></p>
<p>It does not matter if your payment has received any confirmations – just click the <b>[Cancel order]</b> button. The order will vanish from your list (This can be slightly confusing since <b>TMP</b> does not at the time of writing provide any feedback to you as a buyer, but don’t worry – your refund exists). From the menu on the left-hand side under the <b>Orders</b> heading, click the <b>[Refunds]</b> link to bring up the Refunds Window: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/72.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3316" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/72.png" alt="72" width="1350" height="358" /> </a> When the window displays, you will see a list of all the <b>Refunds</b> that are available for you to claim. <b>Remember: One <i>paid</i> cancelled or declined order = one refund.</b> In the <b>Withdraw to wallet</b> field, enter the Bitcoin Address you want your refund sent to and click the <b>[Sign]</b> button. This can be any Bitcoin Address – for example an exchange deposit address, a blockchain.info wallet address, a paper wallet address etc. Wherever you like, just make sure you own it. <a href="/imgs/2014/01/73.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3317" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/73.png" alt="73" width="981" height="239" /> </a> The <b>Transaction</b> window will now be displayed – DONT PANIC! It looks complicated, but its pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it. Remember the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#concepts">Concepts</a>? <b>TMP</b> has taken your requested refund Bitcoin Address and created a signed transaction (inserted their key) into the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> that your Bitcoins are currently sitting in. So, in order for those Bitcoins to be released to you, you – as the buyer – also need to sign on the dotted line (insert your key). Once you’ve signed off, you can broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network and the Bitcoins will wing their way to your nominated Bitcoin Address. <a href="/imgs/2014/01/74.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3318" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/74.png" alt="74" width="975" height="733" /> </a></p>
<p>In the subsequent steps, you’ll be running two commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>signrawtransaction</b>: Allows you to sign-off the transaction (inserts your key into the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>)</li>
<li><b>sendrawtransaction</b>: Broadcasts the signed transaction to the Bitcoin Network. Remember: Bitcoin is a big distributed ledger, it has to <i>know</i> about the transaction or it didn’t happen</li>
</ul>
<p>To run these commands you will need to have Bitcoin-QT installed and connected to the internet. You will also need the Private Key from your repurposed Bitcoin Address that you stored when you created your order (See <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#buyerkey">Steps 24-to-27 in the Buyers Guide</a>). Before we get to the Bitcoin-QT commands, we’re going to decode and check the transaction on <a href="https://blockchain.info/decode-tx">https://blockchain.info/decode-tx</a>. This (and the following step) are purely optional stages, but just lets you feel comfortable that your refund is going to go to the Bitcoin Address you have nominated. Highlight the text between the quotes as demonstrated in the screenshot below, and copy it to your clipboard: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/75.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3319" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/75.png" alt="75" width="977" height="735" /> </a></p>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://blockchain.info/decode-tx">https://blockchain.info/decode-tx</a> inside the TOR browser (to protect your privacy) and paste the text in and click the <b>[Submit Transaction]</b>. The result should be something like that shown below: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/76.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3320" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/76.png" alt="76" width="1206" height="541" /> </a> Now that you’re happy with the proposed refund, you want to sign it off and get back the Bitcoins. Open Bitcoin-QT, go to <b>Menu</b>-&gt;<b>Debug Window</b> and click the <b>Console</b> tab. The view should look like this:</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/77.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3321" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/77.png" alt="77" width="756" height="488" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>You now need to create the <b>signrawtransaction</b> command from the transaction text provided by <b>TMP</b> and the Private Key from the repurposed Bitcoin Address. Mercifully, there are some quick and dirty formatting tools to do most of the work for you at the base of this guide under the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransaction-refundtools">Transaction String Formatting – Refunds</a> heading. There are two stages:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrefund-stage1">Stage 1. Generate *REFUND* DOS bitcoind.exe or Bitcoin-QT GUI Debug compatible signrawtransaction command</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrefund-stage2">Stage 2. Generate *REFUND* DOS bitcoind.exe compatible or Bitcoin-QT GUI Debug compatible sendrawtransaction command</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to use these tools, click the link to <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrefund-stage1">Stage 1</a> above, and paste the requested values into the boxes (The Private Key and the <b>TMP</b> signed transaction text). A helpful screenshot tells you what text you need to copy from the <b>TMP</b> window. Once you’ve done this, click the <b>[Format Refund Transaction]</b> button and copy the blue result text that appears below to your clipboard.</li>
<li>Return to the Bitcoin-QT debug window and paste all the text in and press <b>[Enter]</b>.</li>
<li>You should receive a result something like this in the black text:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/78.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3322" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/78.png" alt="78" width="1059" height="583" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>The most important thing to look out for <b>complete: true</b> – this is the gold you want to see and means the process has worked. The money is <i>nearly</i> yours.</li>
<li>Finally, you need to broadcast the shiny signed transaction to the Bitcoin network. Copy all the black text (outlined in the red box in the screen shot in the previous step) to your clipboard, navigate back down to the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrefund-stage2">Transaction String Formatting – REFUND Stage 2</a> and paste the text in and click <b>[Generate Refund Broadcast Transaction Command]</b>.</li>
<li>Copy the purple text to your clipboard, paste it into the Bitcoin-QT Debug window and hit <b>[Enter]</b> on your keyboard.</li>
<li>You’re done. The return from the <b>sendrawtransaction</b> command will be a transaction ID you can use to monitor the progress of the transaction on the Bitcoin network:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/79.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3323" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/79.png" alt="79" width="1059" height="583" /> </a> The very last step is to return to <b>TMP</b> and click the <b>[Mark as Claimed]</b> button. This just removes the refund from your list so <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>don’t [Mark as Claimed] until you’ve confirmed your Bitcoins have been successfully refunded</b></span>. <a href="/imgs/2014/01/80.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3324" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/80.png" alt="80" width="997" height="731" /> </a></p>
<p>This section covers the setup of your shop and the creation and sale of your first product. The great thing at <b>TMP</b> is that you can configure your store-front and sell yourself one of your products without having to actually obtain full permission from <b>TMP</b> staff to offer products. No one else will be able to buy your products until you are approved, but it does provide a great way to test the process end-to-end without relying on some third party to buy something. The product that we will be creating will be a test. <b>Note:</b> that you will pay a service fee for every completed order to <b>TMP</b>, even if you’ve sold to yourself. So we’ll be using the minimum values possible to reduce your exposure but the process won’t be free. Log in to your <b>TMP</b> account and select the <b>[Become a vendor]</b> menu option on the left hand side: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/81.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3325" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/81.png" alt="81" width="931" height="443" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>Review the Security Policy and Vendor Agreement. Once you are satisfied, select <b>[Continue]</b> from Vendor Agreement screen.</li>
<li>In the <b>Vendor Creation: Shop Settings</b> window provide the name of your shop and an appropriate tag line. Leave the <b>Public</b> checkbox unchecked for now (You will need to change this when you’re account is approved and you want buyers to be able to see your shop). Once you’re happy, click <b>[Next]</b></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/82.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3326" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/82.png" alt="82" width="974" height="419" /> </a></p>
<p>In the <b>Vendor Creation: Profile</b> window, provide some information about yourself, your terms and conditions etc and click <b>[Next]</b> <a href="/imgs/2014/01/83.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3327" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/83.png" alt="83" width="978" height="459" /> </a></p>
<p>In the final agreement window, click <b>[Finish]</b> and your shop will be created. You will now notice that a <b>Shop Management</b> icon has appeared across the top of your menu. Click this to navigate to the shop interface. <b>Note:</b> To approve your shop so that you can receive real orders, you will need to contact the individual listed. This is not necessary for the purposes of this test shop, but remember; until approved your shop is only visible to you. <a href="/imgs/2014/01/84.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-3328" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/84.png" alt="84" width="952" height="403" /> </a></p>
<p>The <b>Shop Management</b> interface gives you an overview of your orders, allows you to manage products, shipping options, orders and – most important – retrieve Bitcoins stored in <b>Bitcoin Deposit Addresses</b> from completed orders. The screen has been annotated below: <a href="/imgs/2014/01/85.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3329" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/85.png" alt="85" width="1294" height="438" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>Lets start by dealing with the most complicated part; creating the keys (read: “wallets” in <b>TMP</b> terminology) you need for orders that you will receive. Click the <b>[Wallets]</b> link on the left hand side and the</li>
<li id="selling-s8">every-time a buyer wants to pay you for an order, <b>TMP</b> forms a <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> from one of your keys, a key it generates internally behind the scenes, and a key provided by the buyer (See steps 23-to-27 of the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#installation">installation</a> section of this guide for a recap of this process from the buyers perspective).</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/86.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3330" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/86.png" alt="86" width="982" height="271" /> </a></p>
<p>As a seller, you therefore need a large stock of keys that can be used by <b>TMP</b> and your buyers to generate a unique <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. For every <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> created, one of your keys is consumed. Annoyingly this can mean that buyers can enter their key, TMP generates the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> using one of yours, one of its own and the buyers key, but then the buyer doesn’t pay and you’re down a key. It is therefore important to remember that the <b>signing wallet count</b> (See Step 6 screenshot) is not reflective of the number of orders you will have. Unpaid orders will never be seen by you – they just cost you a key.</p>
<p>Since a key (read: “wallet”) is just a repurposed Bitcoin Address, there are a number of ways to generate them. One of the easiest way to create a bulk lot of Bitcoin Addresses is using the Bitcoind.exe that comes with Bitcoin-QT (see <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#prerequisites">prerequisites</a> for links). This is a great way to do it because bitcoind then takes care of storing your Bitcoin Addresses (your keys) securely in its own wallet.dat and you can also easily access the private part of each ‘key’ that you need when you come to claim your Bitcoins from completed orders. You’re basically using Bitcoin-QT as a vault to store all your order keys. A guide on this will be covered elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Bitcoin-QT does not need to be connected to the internet, you can create your Bitcoin Addresses you will use as keys completely offline – the magic of Bitcoin math.</p>
<p>The second, simplest but more manually intensive way is to use a Bitcoin Address generator website. Because this is a simple guide to get you into the swing of things, that’s what we’re going to use.</p>
<ol>
<li id="selling-s9">In a separate browser window, navigate to <a href="https://www.bitaddress.org/">https://www.bitaddress.org/</a>. Move your mouse around (if prompted) to begin the initial Bitcoin Address generation process. Once it has returned a Bitcoin Address, open <b>Notepad</b> or your favourite text editor (or you can use Excel). Add three columns; “Bitcoin Address”, “Private Key” and “Public Key (130 Chars)” and copy the Bitcoin Address and Private Key into the Notepad file. Leave the Public Key column blank, we’ll populate that presently. Repeat this process to generate two addresses, the resultant <b>Notepad</b> file should look like:<a href="/imgs/2014/01/87.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3342" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/87.png" alt="87" width="1036" height="443" /> </a></li>
<li id="selling-s10">Click the <b>Wallet Details</b> tab and enter the Private Key from one of the addresses in your <b>Notepad</b> file. Click <b>[View Details]</b> to display all the information about the Bitcoin Address. Highlight the <b>Public Key (130 characters [0-9A-F]):</b> value and paste it alongside the appropriate Bitcoin Address in your <b>Notepad</b> file. Repeat for the second address. The result should look like this:<a href="/imgs/2014/01/88.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3343" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/88.png" alt="88" width="1034" height="418" /> </a></li>
<li>You’ve now generated two order keys! This means that <b>TMP</b> can create two <b>Bitcoin Deposit Addresses</b> and – if your customer pays – you would have two orders. Return to <b>TMP</b> <b>Wallets</b> screen and click the <b>Add Wallets</b> button to add your newly generated keys.<b>Note:</b> Ensure you save the <b>Notepad</b> file somewhere safe. You will need the Private Key against each Bitcoin Address (key) to retrieve the Bitcoins associated with that order.</li>
<li>In this window, you can bulk add a massive amount of keys. For the purposes of this demonstration, we’re just going to add the two we created. The window helpfully tells you how you should format your keys: <b>Bitcoin-Address</b> <b>Bitcoin-Address-Public-Key</b>. Paste the appropriate strings from your <b>Notepad</b> file in to this window, pressing <b>[Enter]</b> to place each key on a new line. The result should look like this:<a href="/imgs/2014/01/88.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3343" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/88.png" alt="88" width="1034" height="418" /> </a>Once you’re done, click the <b>[Add Wallets]</b> button to store your keys in your account.</li>
<li>The screen will now return you to the “Wallets” overview. You will see your shiny new keys have been added, and the adjacent (X) allows you to see if it’s been used to generate a <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> yet. Since you have no orders, this will just show an <b>X</b> against both keys. Remember: Your “wallets” (read: keys) can only be used once; Basically <b>One key to one order (even if unpaid)</b>.<a href="/imgs/2014/01/89.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3344" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/89.png" alt="89" width="980" height="593" /> </a></li>
<li>Once you’re done, click the <b>[Add Wallets]</b> button to store your keys in your account.</li>

<li>You’re now good to create a product and sell it to yourself (excited?). First up, you need to define a Shipping Option. Click the <b>Shipping Options</b> link from the menu on the left hand side. Once the dialog appears, click the <b>[Add]</b> button in the top right to define a new option. Fill in some details and click <b>[Create]</b>.<a href="/imgs/2014/01/911.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3349" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/911.png" alt="91" width="979" height="367" /> </a>You’ll be returned to the <b>Shipping Options</b> screen where your available options will be summarised.<a href="/imgs/2014/01/921.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3350" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/921.png" alt="92" width="977" height="316" /> </a></li>
<li>The next stage is to create a product to sell to yourself. Click the <b>Products</b> link from the menu on the left-hand side. The <b>Products</b> summary screen will be displayed.<a href="/imgs/2014/01/931.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3351" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/931.png" alt="93" width="980" height="218" /> </a></li>
<li>Click the <b>[Add]</b> button to begin the Product creation process.Create your product along the lines demonstrated in the screenshot below. Ensure the <b>Visible</b> box is <b>not</b> checked (You don’t want to show the test product if you’ve asked for your account to be approved) and also ensure you minimize the cost of your product to the lowest amount possible (Just incase things go wrong).<a href="/imgs/2014/01/94.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3352" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/94.png" alt="94" width="982" height="1630" /> </a></li>
<li>When you’re happy, click <b>[Create]</b> to add the product to your inventory.Once the product has been added, you’ll receive notification across the top bar and the page will redisplay your product in ‘update’ mode. Also a new button will appear; <b>[View on site]</b>. The <b>[view on site]</b> button allows you to preview your product as your buyers would. It also allows you to purchase the product yourself, allowing you to test the order process.<a href="/imgs/2014/01/95.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3353" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/95.png" alt="95" width="1274" height="306" /> </a>Click the <b>View on site</b>. This will open a new tab showing your product. Select a Shipping Option and choose <b>[Add to Cart]</b><a href="/imgs/2014/01/96.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3354" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/96.png" alt="96" width="995" height="399" /> </a>The product will now be added to your cart and you’ll be able to preview the process as any buyer would. In order to save space, navigate back up this guide and follow <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#checkout">Steps 21 to 35 inclusive</a> of the buyers guide. Once you’ve done that, return here and click the <b>Shop Management</b> link to return to the shop management overview screen.</li>
<li>As soon as the payment for the recently created order has cleared (reached 6 confirmations), your management view will show the order in the <b>New Orders</b> sub-window. Go ahead and click <b>[View]</b> next to the order:</li>
<li><a href="/imgs/2014/01/97.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3355" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/97.png" alt="97" width="972" height="348" /> </a></li>
<li>You now be presented with the order summary screen. Shipping information, payment and product information is summarised here. You also now have the option of either accepting or rejecting the order. Click <b>[Approve]</b><a href="/imgs/2014/01/98.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3356" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/98.png" alt="98" width="969" height="766" /> </a></li>
<li>Now you have accepted the order, your view will change to allow you to migrate the order to the final state of fulfilment: Shipped. At this point, you can either click <b>Mark As Shipped</b> or leap back to the <b>Orders</b> overview so you can see how the various sub-windows have updated. Once you are happy, return to the order and click <b>[Mark As Shipped]</b>:<a href="/imgs/2014/01/99.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3357" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/99.png" alt="99" width="1032" height="256" /> </a></li>
<li>Finally, once you have shipped the order, it will migrate to <b>Shipped Orders</b> sub-window. Shipped orders are ones which require no further interaction from you. At this point, the buyer needs to <b>Finalize</b> the transaction to indicate the goods have been received and you can move on to the final stage and claim your Bitcoins.<a href="/imgs/2014/01/100.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3358" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/100.png" alt="100" width="977" height="518" /> </a></li>
<li>As you are the buyer in this transaction, you need to return to the buyers view so you can <b>Finalize</b> the order. To do this, click on your account name and select <b>Account</b> from the menu. From the left hand-menu, under the <b>Orders</b> heading, click <b>[List]</b>.</li>
<li>When the order details screen comes up, click the <b>Finalize order</b> button. Leave yourself a nice review, you deserve it. Once you are done, return to the <b>Shop Management</b> interface.</li>
<li>Before you can collect payment, you need to make sure you have nominated a Bitcoin Address that <b>TMP</b> will use to generate the transaction that releases the Bitcoins from the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> to you. To do this click the <b>Settings</b> link from the menu and the <b>Vendor Settings</b> window will be displayed:</li>
<li><a href="/imgs/2014/01/101.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3359" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/101.png" alt="101" width="970" height="657" /> </a></li>
<li>Enter the Bitcoin Address that you want to use to receive the Bitcoins retrieved from the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. This could be an exchange deposit address, a blockchain.info wallet address a paper wallet – anywhere you like. Just make sure it’s one you own. When you are done click <b>[Save]</b>.Finally, lets retrieve payment. From the menu on the left-hand side, select <b>[Payments]</b> to bring up the payments window. This shows all the payments (remember it’s one payment per order) that are waiting for you. Click the <b>[Sign]</b> button against the payment.<a href="/imgs/2014/01/102.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3360" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/102.png" alt="102" width="1075" height="304" /> </a></li>
<li>You are now presented with the signing window – DONT PANIC! It looks complicated, but its pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.As indicated in the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#concepts">Concepts</a> part of this guide, this is basically the transaction that has been created and signed by <b>TMP</b> and now just needs your signature to release the funds to you. There are two commands shown in this window, the first is <b>signrawtransaction</b> which when run, is basically you signing on the dotted line and giving authorisation to move the Bitcoins from the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> used for the order to your nominated Bitcoin Address. The transaction also includes <b>TMP’s</b> service fee which is sent to a Bitcoin Address they choose. You can actually decode the transaction to see what’s going to go where by pasting the highlighted text into <a href="https://blockchain.info/decode-tx">https://blockchain.info/decode-tx</a>:<a href="/imgs/2014/01/103.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone  wp-image-3361" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/103.png" alt="103" width="997" height="734" /> </a></li>
<li>and this is what you should see on <a href="https://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a> (Remember to only visit in TOR Browser – just to ensure your privacy)<a href="/imgs/2014/01/104.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3362" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/104.png" alt="104" width="1203" height="654" /> </a></li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The second command is <b>sendrawtransaction</b> and all this does is broadcast the transaction you signed to the Bitcoin network (need a Bitcoin-QT client with an internet connection for this). Only then can the actual Bitcoin transfer take place (remember; Bitcoin is a big distributed ledger, it has to <i>know</i> about it, or it didn’t happen).Now that you (hopefully) understand the commands you are going to run – you need to run them. To be able to that we are now going to switch back to Bitcoin-QT which you’ve hopefully got running.</li>
<li>To run the commands open Bitcoin-QT, go to <b>Menu</b>-&gt;<b>Debug Window</b> and click the <b>Console</b> tab. The view should look like this:</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><a href="/imgs/2014/01/105.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3363" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/105.png" alt="105" width="756" height="488" /> </a></li>
<li>Open the <b>Notepad</b> file you created back in stage 10, and copy the Private Key associated with the Bitcoin Address indicated in the <b>TMP</b> Transaction window to your clipboard (highlighted in blue below):</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/106.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3364" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/106.png" alt="106" width="1188" height="278" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>You now need to insert the private key in place of the text marked <b>PRIVATEKEYHERE</b> in the string and then copy everything from the word <b>signrawtransaction</b> to your clipboard and paste the result into the Bitcoin-QT debug window. Mercifully, there are some quick and dirty string formatting tools to do most of the work for you at the base of this guide under the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransaction-paymentretrieval">Transaction String Formatting – Payment Retrieval</a> heading.</li>
<li>Paste your private key that’s (hopefully) still on your clipboard in the <b>Private Key</b> box and all the text from the <b>signrawtransaction</b> box into the <b>Transaction text</b> box and press <b>[Format Transaction]</b>.</li>
<li>Now copy all the blue text onto your clipboard and return to the Bitcoin-QT debug window and paste it in and press <b>[Enter]</b>.</li>
<li>You should receive a result something like this in black text:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/107.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3365" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/107.png" alt="107" width="1059" height="583" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>The most important thing to look out for <b>complete: true</b> – this is the gold you want to see and means the process has worked. The money is <i>nearly</i> yours.</li>
<li>Finally, you need to broadcast the shiny signed transaction to the Bitcoin network. Copy all the black text (outlined in the red box in the screen shot in the previous step) to your clipboard, navigate back down to the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransaction">Transaction String Formatting</a> area <b>Stage 2</b> and paste the text in and click <b>[Generate Broadcast Transaction Command]</b>.</li>
<li>Copy the purple text to your clipboard, paste it into the Bitcoin-QT Debug window and hit <b>[Enter]</b> on your keyboard.</li>
<li>You’re done. The return from the <b>sendrawtransaction</b> command will be a transaction ID you can use to monitor the progress of the transaction on the Bitcoin network:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/108.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3366" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/108.png" alt="108" width="1059" height="583" /> </a></p>
<p>The very last step is to return to <b>TMP</b> and click the <b>[Mark as Claimed]</b> button. This just removes the transaction from your list so <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>don’t [Mark as Claimed] until you’ve confirmed your Bitcoins have been successfully redeemed</b></span>.</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/109.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3367" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/109.png" alt="109" width="1040" height="354" /> </a></p>
<p>A few final words. Don’t worry about re-running the claim commands a few times, when you broadcast the transaction (<b>sendrawtransaction</b>) the Bitcoin network will only recognise the first successful attempt, so any further tries won’t yield more Bitcoins, they’ll just be ignored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this section we cover how to go about recovering Bitcoins from a <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> without using <b>TMP</b>. The purpose is to illustrate that, in the event of <b>TMP</b> collapsing, sellers and buyers can still complete outstanding <b>paid</b> orders lessening the financial impact on both the parties involved (buyer and seller). If you have not covered the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#concepts">Concepts</a> section of this guide, take a moment to recap before continuing. Since this tutorial is primarily aimed at sellers, we’re going to be selling ourselves a product (See <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#selling">Selling on The Marketplace</a> section). This makes it easy to ensure we’ve got access to the necessary keys required to unlock the Bitcoins in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> for the order we’re going to create.</p>
<p>Before beginning, there are a few things that – sellers especially – should be aware of. In order to recover any of the Bitcoins that reside in an order <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>, both the seller and the buyer have to be able to contact each other. This is necessary because either the buyer or the seller is going to need to fill the shoes of <b>TMP</b> and create and sign a transaction (insert their key) that will then be provided to the counter-party to also sign-off on (insert their key) and broadcast the result to the Bitcoin network so the Bitcoins can be released from the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. Since a buyer and a seller do not ever come into direct contact with each-other through <b>TMP</b> except when using <b>TMP’s</b> messaging system (remember; orders a seller receives are never explicitly tied to a <b>TMP</b> buyer’s account), establishing communication channels can be the trickiest part.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, buyers who have paid for an order but who have not had their order accepted by a seller at the time of <b>TMP’s</b> closure or have not yet received a shipped order, are going to be more inclined to make the effort to get in contact with the seller. Buyers who have received their order but had not <b>Finalized</b> it at the time of <b>TMP’s</b> closure are significantly less likely to make the effort to help the seller recover any Bitcoins trapped in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> for the particular order. The buyer won’t be able to recover the Bitcoins either, so there is no financial gain – it just means that the Bitcoins will remain trapped in eternity until either <b>TMP</b> recovers, or the two parties (buyer and seller) can get in contact and come to an agreement.</p>
<p>To summarise; as a seller do not assume you will be able to recover all outstanding funds owed to you for shipped orders. You should be able to recover something though, and something is better than nothing. It’s also 100% more than traditional trust based darknet markets (E.g. Pandora, SilkRoad2, BlueSky etc).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If <b>TMP</b> subsequently returns after an outage, a seller can set about reclaiming any Bitcoins in outstanding orders where the buyer was uncontactable, using the platforms built in mechanisms (See <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#selling">Steps 23-to-34 in the Sellers section</a>) and a buyer can set about recovering Bitcoins from any <b>Unapproved</b> order through the refund mechanism (See <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#refunds">All steps in the Order Refunds section</a>). It may be a bit of an auditing headache to reconcile everything; remove orders that have been claimed outside <b>TMP</b> and claim orders that haven’t, but that’s it. Because the Bitcoins for each paid order are sitting in their <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> it’s just a matter of claiming them. A seller doesn’t have to trust <b>TMP</b> to have a wallet filled with Bitcoins to back an ephemeral website balance (Think: Sheep Market and the Bitcoin withdrawal issues suffered near its end when someone had run away with all the money).</p>
<p>How a seller and their buyers get in contact with each-other is a matter of personal choice. It could be as simple as including a contact email address on the vendor profile, posting a PGP encrypted message (encrypted with the public PGP key of the recipient) on a high-traffic social platform such as Reddit, or through a more secure durable communication platform such Bitmessage combined with TOR (recommended approach).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The use of Bitmessage is not covered in this tutorial. Links to a simple tutorial are provided in the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#prerequisites">Prerequisites section</a> of this guide.</p>
<p>Let’s begin…</p>
<p>Place an order with yourself by following <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#selling">Steps 8 to 18 inclusive of the Sellers</a> section. Click the <b>[Shop Management]</b> link on the top menu-bar to view your shops overview. You should see your recently <b>paid</b> order sitting in the <b>New Orders</b> sub-window:</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/109.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3367" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/109.png" alt="109" width="1040" height="354" /> </a> <a href="/imgs/2014/01/110.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3368" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/110.png" alt="110" width="987" height="357" /> </a></p>
<p>Click the <b>[View]</b> button adjacent to order to bring up the order detail screen. When this displays, click the <b>[Show Payment Information]</b> button along the top:</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/1111.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3369" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1111.png" alt="111" width="990" height="384" /> </a></p>
<p>to display the payment information associated with this order:</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/112.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3370" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/112.png" alt="112" width="1198" height="960" /> </a></p>
<p>Now that you hopefully have a better understanding of the information shown on the <b>Payment Information</b> screen, you will want to know which bits are actually relevant to make you able to retrieve the Bitcoins outside of <b>TMP</b>. The only pieces of information you need from this screen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Redeem Script</b>; and</li>
<li>The <b>Escrow Wallet</b> (This is the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>); and</li>
<li>The <b>Transaction ID</b>; and</li>
<li>The <b>Sellers Public Key</b></li>
</ul>
<p>You might be wondering why you don’t need the other ‘Public’ keys? You don’t need them because – as the seller – you already have the ‘Private’ part of your key to the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>, which you recorded in your <b>Notepad</b> file in <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#selling-s8">Steps 8, 9 and 10 of the Sellers section</a>. The ‘Private’ part of your <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> key is effectively the <i>real</i> key, while the ‘Public’ part is the equivalent of being able to tell the world that you have ownership of the ‘Private’ part but doesn’t allow anyone who has it to use it to move Bitcoins out of the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. ‘Private’ trumps ‘Public’.</p>
<p>You are recording the sellers public key because it will make it easier for you to track down the correct Private Key to use to sign-off the transaction. If you’ve got 1000′s of keys – all for different orders – it would be a management nightmare trying to work out which Private Key you needed to use to unlock the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. Recording it here means you can just search the <b>Notepad</b> file you created <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#selling-s10">Step 10 of the Sellers section</a> (or whatever storage method you’ve chosen to use).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Because you are also acting as the buyer in this tutorial, you will also have access to the buyers Private key which you recorded in <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#buyerkey">Steps 24 and 25 of the Buyers section</a> when you placed your order. In normal circumstances you would not have access to this and so once you created and signed the transaction (inserted your key), you would pass the signed transaction to the buyer for them to also sign-off (insert their key) and broadcast the result to Bitcoin Network to release the Bitcoins from the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. Don’t worry, this will all be covered in detail in the following steps.</p>
<p>Open <b>Notepad</b> or your favourite text editor, and create four columns: <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>, <b>Transaction ID</b>, <b>Redeem Script</b> and <b>Sellers Public Key</b>. Copy the values from the <b>Payment Information</b> screen. The result should look something like this:</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/113.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3371" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/113.png" alt="113" width="1640" height="841" /> </a></p>
<p>You now have the information you – as the seller – need to create and sign (insert your key) the transaction. For the next part we’re going to be using a combination of <a href="https://blockchain.info/rawtx">https://blockchain.info/rawtx</a> (Visit in TOR) and the Bitcoin-QT Debug window. You can do <i>everything</i> in the Bitcoin-QT Debug window but by using <a href="https://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a>, we minimize the chances of mistakes.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin commands we will be running are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>createrawtransaction</b>: (Run by: Seller) – Creates the transaction that releases the Bitcoins from the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> to the sellers chosen Bitcoin Address (a paper wallet, blockchain.info wallet or Bitcoin exchange – any Bitcoin Address the seller owns)</li>
<li><b>signrawtransaction</b>: (Run by: Seller <b>and</b> Buyer) – Two keys must be inserted to release the Bitcoins, so the first signatory (key insertion) will be from the seller. The seller will run this command (<b>signrawtransaction</b>) on the result from <b>createrawtransaction</b> in the step above. The output will then be passed to the buyer who will also run <b>signrawtransaction</b> to sign off (insert their key) and the final result can then be broadcast to the Bitcoin Network.</li>
<li><b>sendrawtransaction</b>: (Run by: Seller <b>or</b> Buyer) – Broadcasts the transaction that has been signed by both the seller <i>and</i> buyer to the Bitcoin Network so the Bitcoins are actually moved (Remember; the Bitcoin Network needs to <i>know</i> about it or it didn’t happen). The transaction that is broadcast must be the one that both the buyer and seller have signed off on. In this tutorial this will be when the buyer runs <b>signrawtransaction</b> (final key in the lock). If the seller wants to broadcast the transaction, they can ask the buyer to just send them the result of <b>signrawtransaction</b> and then they (the seller) can run <b>sendrawtransaction</b> themselves. The result of running this command successfully is the transaction ID, which can be plugged in to <a href="https://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a> to check its progress on the Bitcoin Network (number of confirmations etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>To run the commands open Bitcoin-QT, go to Menu-&gt;Debug Window and click the Console tab. The view should look like this:</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/114.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3372" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/114.png" alt="114" width="756" height="488" /> </a></p>
<ol>
<li>To create the raw transaction, we need to know some information about the transaction that was used to deposit the Bitcoins into the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. Fortunately, <a href="https://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a> stores this information in an easily accessible manner, but you need to go to a special URL to get it. You can reach it by manually putting <b>https://blockchain.info/rawtx/{REPLACE-ME-WITH-THE-TRANSACTION-ID-YOU-RECORDED-IN-THE-TEXT-FILE-IN-STEP-3}?scripts=true</b> into your address bar, but mercifully, tools exist under the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransaction-rawtx">Transaction String Formatting – Create My Own Raw Transaction</a> to guide you through the process (which is what we’ll use).

Copy the link into your browser address bar (or click it) and copy all the text in the box highlighted onto your clipboard. Helpful screenshots by the stages tell you what text you need to copy where.</li>
<li>Progress to <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrawtx-stage2">Stage 2</a> and enter the information requested. You will source the <b>Transaction text</b> from <b>Stage 1</b> which you have just run, while the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> and <b>Redeem Script</b> will come from the details you noted down in <b>Step 3</b> from the <b>TMP</b> <b>Payment Information</b> screen. Once you have generated and run the <b>createrawtransaction</b> command, running it in Bitcoin-QT debug window should yield a long string in black text:</li>
<li><a href="/imgs/2014/01/115.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3373" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/115.png" alt="115" width="1059" height="631" /> </a></li>
<li>Ensuring you leave all the boxes in <b>Stage 2</b> populated, move on to <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrawtx-stage3">Stage 3</a>. For this you will need the Private key that is associated with the repurposed Bitcoin Address that you have – as the seller – used as your key to the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b>. You should have this in a <b>Notepad</b> file which you made in <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#selling-s10">Step 10 of the Sellers section</a>. Search this file for the <b>sellers public key</b> you recorded back in <b>Step 3.</b> and enter the Private Key that is on the same row:</li>

<p>Once you’ve got the <i>signrawtransaction</i> command text back from half-way through <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrawtx-stage3">Stage 3</a>, run it in Bitcoin-QT Debug window. Notice that the result says <b>complete: false</b> (highlighted in green in the screenshot below). This means that only one signatory (you; the seller) has signed off (inserted their key). One more signatory is required (the buyer) before the Bitcoins in the <b>Bitcoin Deposit Address</b> can be released.</p>
<p><a href="/imgs/2014/01/116.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3374" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/116.png" alt="116" width="1165" height="525" /> </a> <a href="/imgs/2014/01/117.png" rel="lightbox"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3375" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/117.png" alt="117" width="1059" height="631" /> </a></p>
<p>Copy the resulting black text (everything inside the red box in the screenshot above) into the <b>Seller Signed Transaction Text</b> box <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#createtx-stage35">midway through <b>Stage 3</b></a> and click the <b>[Generate Transaction Signing Text For Buyer]</b>. At this stage, you would normally send the resulting text to the buyer who would then continue the process from <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrawtx-stage2">Stage 4</a>, but since you are also the buyer just paste the resulting output into the <b>Transaction Text provided to you by the Seller</b> box along with the buyers Private Key (You should have hopefully stored this when you paid for your order – see <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#buyerkey">Steps 24-to-27 in the Buyers Section</a> to recap).</p>
<p>Press the <b>[Generate Buyers Transaction Signing Command]</b> and run the resulting output in Bitcoin-QT Debug Window. If the process has worked, you will see <b>complete: true</b> (highlighted in green in the screenshot below) . This is the gold you are looking for. This means the transaction is ready to be broadcast to the Bitcoin Network. The money is nearly yours!</p>

<li>Copy all the black text highlighted in the red box in the screenshot above to your clipboard and paste it in to the <b>Signed Transaction Text provided by the Buyer</b> box in <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrawtx-stage5">Stage 5</a>. Click the <b>[Generate Buyer-Seller Signed Broadcast Transaction Command]</b> to generate the final command.</li>
<li>Paste the result of <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#formattransactionrawtx-stage5">Stage 5</a> into your Bitcoin-QT Debug window and run it. If the process has worked, you’ll be returned a transaction ID and your Bitcoins should be winging their way to you.</li>

<li value="12">That’s it. You’re done. Really. You may wish to house-clean so you don’t have a now unusable order clogging up your list. You can do that by declining it in the <b>Shop Management</b> view, and then – as the buyer – navigating to your refunds screen and just putting a random Bitcoin address into the claim screen and hitting the <b>[Mark As Claimed]</b> button. For detailed overview of the Refund process, see the <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/12/30/full-guide-how-to-access-i2p-sites-use-themarketplace-i2p#refunds">Refunds</a> section.</li>
</ol>
<p>A final cautionary note. Although (if you’re suitably masochistic) you might be thinking that you can circumvent <b>TMP’s</b> fees this way, you can – but they’ll find out. Remember, <b>TMP</b> is a key holder in every order, so it is trivial for them check paid <b>Bitcoin Deposit Addresses</b> and see which ones have had their funds spent without giving <b>TMP</b> their fee… repeat offenders (without mitigating circumstances) are likely to risk having their accounts closed. It’s in everyone’s interest to ensure everyone else gets their slice of the cake, so that buyers and sellers have somewhere safe, secure and reliable to conduct business on.</p>
<p>The default string that is provided when you want to claim a transaction does not work with the Windows Bitcoin Daemon. The reason is the escapement of quotes. This JavaScript will format the transaction into a block you can paste into a DOS box and get your signed transaction from.</p>
