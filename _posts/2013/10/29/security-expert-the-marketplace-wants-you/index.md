<p>A new marketplace we have mentioned here last week  &#8220;<a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2013/10/20/oh-joy-yet-another-marketplace-in-progress-the-marketplace/">The Marketplace</a>&#8221; is looking for IT / UI experts and old time verified vendors for beta testing of their system security,</p>
<p>Was posted on Reddit today:  http://www.reddit.com/r/themarketplace/comments/1pgl7k/beta_applications_now_open/<br/>

<em> Hash: SHA512</em></p>
<p><em>Hi,</em></p>
<p><em>We are proud, excited and nervous to announce that we are accepting beta tester applications for</em><br/>
<em> The Marketplace. We only accept people who do security/ui tests on the site and provide feedback to us,</em><br/>
<em> vendors with at least 3 months of history and well known community members. We hope to engage both</em><br/>
<em> vendors and users to create a market place which is community driven and is not run by any single</em><br/>
<em> group.</em></p>
<p><em>We believe that our market place is the most secure option available and will enable both sellers and</em><br/>
<em> buyers to operate in a much safer environment than is currently available. We feel that The Marketplace</em><br/>
<em> will stand the test of time and will continue to provide a safe option to consenting adults much like</em><br/>
<em> it&#8217;s predecessor.</em></p>
<p><em>Our marketplace is built on creating the most least-trust environment possible. We have disabled</em><br/>
<em> javascript and prevented users accesing the site with javascript though we have used CSS3 in place</em><br/>
<em> where possible, we have enforced PGP encryption so that users will be required to send PGP encrypted</em><br/>
<em> communication at all times and we have built a tumbler that will help keep users anonymous which will be</em><br/>
<em> replaced by our Bitcoin Contract implementation shortly.</em></p>
<p><em>If you are a vendor and would like to apply, please send us a pgp signed message with links to</em><br/>
<em> existing signed messages.</em><br/>
<em> If you are a security/UI tester and would like to apply, please send us details on what you will</em><br/>
<em> check for and what you think could be potential weak points. We will pay what we can for any major</em><br/>
<em> security flaws and will not let the report go unrewarded.</em></p>
<p><em>If you are accepted, you will recieve a reply in 1-2 days with a link to our site and we will notify</em><br/>
<em> you if you are accepted.</em></p>
<p><em>Send applications to TMPSchultz@safe-mail.net</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks,</em><br/>
<em> TMPSchultz</em></p>

<p>Personally, i find this marketplace as one of the more interesting options to come, so we will keep an open eye to see how this develops,</p>
<p>and if you want to help &#8211; Feel free to contact them.</p>
