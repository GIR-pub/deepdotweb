<p>New blue banner posted on Agora:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="market-wide-message">Payments are mostly restored, but we&#8217;re expecting some delays for new ones in the coming days.</span></p></blockquote>
<img src="imgs/2015/05/blue-agora-banner.png"><img src="/imgs/2015/05/blue-agora-banner.png" alt="blue-agora-banner" width="826" height="73" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10211" srcset="/imgs/2015/05/blue-agora-banner.png 826w, /imgs/2015/05/blue-agora-banner-300x27.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" /></a></p>
<p>We had multiple confirmations that things are pretty much workings, but with long delays.</p>
