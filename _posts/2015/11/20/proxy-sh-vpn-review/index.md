<p>For some time now, we have been looking into performance and services of Proxy.sh VPN. Most of our readers are in need of a comprehensive review to find out whether or not this <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/vpn-comparison-chart/">VPN service provider</a> can really live up to its promises.</p>
<p>For this reason, we have decided to conduct a detailed review of Proxy.sh VPN services, so that you and the rest of our readers will finally have the necessary data and information that you require, in order to evaluate if their VPN services can truly fulfill your online security and privacy needs.</p>
<p>To start the review, here are some useful details and information about their company.</p>
<p><a href="https://proxy.sh/panel/aff.php?aff=995" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12149" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-home.png" alt="proxysh-home" width="1252" height="611" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-home.png 1252w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-home-300x146.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-home-1024x500.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1252px) 100vw, 1252px" /></a></p>
<h3>About the Company</h3>
<p>Proxy.sh is a Seychelles based VPN service provider that offers fast, discreet and secured VPN connections to over 20,000 clients around the globe. Their organization is composed of anonymous individuals from different countries, such as Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Laos, Philippines, Russia, Seychelles, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand.</p>
<p>Their company started operating in 2012, offering various proxy technologies to online users. They conduct a non-for-profit operation, spending one third of their company earnings on developing and expanding their VPN servers, and the remaining two thirds for paying contractors and the salaries of their employees.</p>
<p>At present, Proxy.sh is operating with 300+ VPN servers located across 52 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>Proxy.sh Free Trial</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the usage of VPN services, it is recommended that we first test the performance of a VPN provider before we decide to spend our hard earned money and subscribe to one of their available packages. Luckily, most of the major VPN service providers in the market offers a free trial subscription for one or more of their plans and packages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, based on our research and our first-hand experience in using the services of Proxy.sh for this review, we found out that they do not offer any free trial on any of their services. Furthermore, they do not offer any refund or money back guarantee to customers, BUT they do offer a very low priced testing subscription package of $2 for 72 hours that we can avail for making sure that we are satisfied with their services, before we decide to invest in one of their more expensive subscription plans.</p>

<h2>Interface and Setup &#8211; Proxy.sh</h2>
<p>Proxy.sh uses a custom VPN client called Safejumper. This user-friendly software application allows users to connect to various Proxy.sh ports, protocols, locations and VPN networks securely and easily. Moreover, this software enables subscribers to fine tune their account and network settings with just a few taps or clicks.</p>
<p>The Proxy.sh Safejumper software has several versions that can be used for the following device platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>MacOS</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>iOS</li>
<li>Android.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this review, we will use the Safejumper version for Windows to evaluate and test how their interface and setup process works.</p>
<h3>Installing the Safejumper application for Windows</h3>
<p>To be able to connect to Proxy.sh VPN network we had to download the Safejumper software installer on our Windows based device.</p>
<p>We were able to download the mProxy.sh VPN software from their website just after subscribing.</p>
<p>After downloading the software installer, we accessed the directory where we saved the installer file and ran it using the administrator mode.</p>
<p>We then selected a file location where we want to install Safejumper and waited for the installer to complete its installation process.</p>
<p>After the installation was completed, a dialogue box appeared, asking us if we want to install TAP-Windows Provider V9 Network adapter. We clicked on the install button to continue the installation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12150" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-install.png" alt="proxysh-install" width="561" height="247" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-install.png 561w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-install-300x132.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></p>
<p>After the installation of TAP-Windows Provider V9 Network adapter was completed, we clicked on the close button to finish the setup process.</p>
<p>We were able to see a Safejumper icon on our desktop, which confirms that the installation of the software was successful.</p>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12157" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-safejump.png" alt="proxysh-safejump" width="261" height="269" /></h3>
<h3>Connecting to the Proxy.sh VPN network</h3>
<p>We ran the Safejumper application and entered our username and password on the fields provided.</p>
<p>After entering our username and password, we clicked on the login button to continue to the main interface of the software.</p>
<p>We clicked on the connect button at the bottom of the main menu to connect to the VPN network location and protocol indicated on the interface.</p>
<p>The Safejumper icon turned green, indicating that we are safely connected to the VPN network.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12158" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-safejump2.png" alt="proxysh-safejump2" width="293" height="280" /></p>
<p>In general, the Proxy.sh interface and installer is easy to use and ok to look at. Users can effortlessly choose a network location and protocol, adjust account and network settings, and even jump into the next VPN network location with just a few simple clicks or taps on the software interface.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12159" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-safejump3.png" alt="proxysh-safejump3" width="334" height="320" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-safejump3.png 334w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-safejump3-300x287.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px" /></p>
<h2>Security –Proxy.sh</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12148" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-feature.png" alt="proxysh-feature" width="1188" height="504" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-feature.png 1188w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-feature-300x127.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-feature-1024x434.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1188px) 100vw, 1188px" /></p>
<p>Proxy.sh offers one of the most advanced security technology in the market. They not only provide users with access to multiple encryption protocols, such as OpenVPN-TCP (256 bit encryption), OpenVPN-UDP (256 bit encryption), PPTP (MPPE 128bit cipher) and L2TP (256 bit encryption), but they also provide other proxy technologies like SOCKS and HTTP proxy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Proxy.sh supports other encryption methods and protocols, which includes TOR, SoftEther, ECC, obfsproxy, and XOR.</p>
<h3>Privacy -Proxy.sh</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12151" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-map.png" alt="proxysh-map" width="640" height="498" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-map.png 640w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-map-300x233.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In terms of privacy, Proxy.sh is one of the best in the world. They maintain a 100% no usage log policy to protect the privacy of their users, and unlike other VPN providers on the net, they do not keep any connection logs.</p>
<p>The only information that they keep is the type of package that you purchased and the email address that you used to pay for your subscription, which is linked to your payment method. They even allow fake email addresses to be used to further protect your anonymity.</p>
<p>Moreover, when obliged by the law to share information, they will only do so, if they can inform their customers in advance through their Transparency Report, and if they are told not to do so, they will circumvent this illegal censorship with their Warrant Canary. This is an EXCELLENT policy for those using the VPN to make your time on the Darknet Markets more secure and private.</p>
<p>If all fails, their company will be more than willing to cease operations in the involved jurisdiction, in order to protect the privacy of their users.</p>
<p>Besides, their company is based in Seychelles, which is considered one of the best countries in regards to protecting online privacy and anonymity, and based on our research, the worst action that they took, in terms of DCMA policy request, is to shut down the concerned server involved in the dispute.</p>

<h2>Speed – Proxy.sh</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12160" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-speed.png" alt="proxysh-speed" width="1233" height="609" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-speed.png 1233w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-speed-300x148.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-speed-1024x506.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1233px) 100vw, 1233px" /></p>
<p>Proxy.sh offers a free VPN speed test feature for their network, which is very useful for potential customers who want to check the connection speed that they can expect from the VPN service.</p>
<p>But, for this review, we didn’t want to use Proxy.sh owns speed test application to avoid any bias towards their network. So, we decided to use Ookla for the testing the network speed of Proxy.sh.</p>
<p>Based on our results, the connection speed did drop when we were connected to their VPN. The drop in connection speed is expected when users connect to any VPN network. It is the price that we pay for security. The speed was still pretty good to browser around on Tor, stream video and music.</p>
<p>Usability – Proxy.sh</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12152" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-map2.png" alt="proxysh-map2" width="1129" height="451" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-map2.png 1129w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-map2-300x120.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-map2-1024x409.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1129px) 100vw, 1129px" /></p>
<p>Using Proxy.sh VPN service is a pleasurable experience. Their VPN client is simple to use and easy to understand. There are no complex procedures to perform, you just have to click or tap a few interface buttons and your online connection will be instantly protected by their service.</p>
<p>Proxy.sh VPN allows up to 3 devices connected to the VPN network at the same time, giving users the freedom to use multiple gadgets while surfing the net. Aside from that, network traffic is not an issue with Proxy.sh. With over 300 VPN networks to choose from and the existence of multiple servers on popular locations, users can rest assured that they can connect to their favorite online TV show, website and application without difficulty.</p>

<h3>Check out Process-Proxy.sh</h3>
<p>For this review, we purchased a Proxy.sh plan to check their payment process and procedures.</p>
<p><a href="https://proxy.sh/panel/aff.php?aff=995" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12142" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-checkout.png" alt="proxysh-checkout" width="1034" height="349" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-checkout.png 1034w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-checkout-300x101.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-checkout-1024x346.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1034px) 100vw, 1034px" /></a></p>
<p>We selected the Solid plan and clicked on the GET STARTED button.</p>
<p>We were directed to their package configuration pages, giving us the option to choose between subscribing for a month, 6 months or a year.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12145" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-config.png" alt="proxysh-config" width="1089" height="524" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-config.png 1089w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-config-300x144.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-config-1024x493.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1089px) 100vw, 1089px" /></p>
<p>We opted for a month and clicked on the Add to Cart button. We continued on to the Order Summary page, and because we had no Voucher Code available to get a discount, we just clicked on the Checkout button to proceed with the subscription process.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12153" src="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-ordersum.png" alt="proxysh-ordersum" width="1048" height="470" srcset="https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-ordersum.png 1048w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-ordersum-300x135.png 300w, https://www.deepdotweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/proxysh-ordersum-1024x459.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1048px) 100vw, 1048px" /></p>

<p>Proxy.sh provides 24/7 customer support through their online ticketing system. Additional information and answers to common questions and inquires can also be found in their Blog, FAQ’s and Knowledgebase Page.</p>
<p>Although, their website states that their support is 24/7, it also says that their average respond time is 12 hours. However, we tried to test their response time by creating a ticket, and we were happy with the results, because we got a reply within an hour.</p>
<h2>Conclusion – Proxy.sh</h2>
<p>Based on our review, Proxy.sh is a great VPN provider when it comes to securing and protecting your privacy and identity online. Their state of the art encryption technologies is at par with the best VPN providers in the world. They have first class policies when it comes to protecting their user’s privacy and anonymity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we did not like that they do not offer any free trial and refund policy (except for PayPal payments). They also have monthly usage caps on the plans and although they are pretty high it is still a cap. It is a small price to pay for the level of anonymity they provide though.</p>
<p>Overall, we highly recommend Proxy.sh for those who prioritize their privacy and security while using the clear and dark net. We also recommended it to those who engage in heavy P2P activities.</p>
