In this TorGuard Review we will enlighten you with everything you need to know about this service.</p>
    <p>TorGuard, a VPN service from USA, Miami, has become one of the most popular VPN services in the world. In today’s age of increased spying, many Internet users do not want to compromise on their online privacy. Luckily, the company has a great deal of secure VPN features to make your online connection fully anonymous and private. TorGuard VPN has <strong>multiple servers located in different countries, including</strong> U.S., Germany, U.K., France, Russia, Australia, Netherlands, Canada and Romania among others.</p>

Simply sign up for their service and if you are not happy with it for any reason before the 7 days is up then you get a full refund.

    <p><strong>Interface and Setup </strong></p>
    <p>Set up is quite easy. Once you pay for your subscription, you will have several options to setup TorGuard.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12139" src="/imgs/2015/11/torguad-panel.png" alt="torguad-panel" width="500" height="500" srcset="/imgs/2015/11/torguad-panel.png 500w, /imgs/2015/11/torguad-panel-150x150.png 150w, /imgs/2015/11/torguad-panel-300x300.png 300w, /imgs/2015/11/torguad-panel-55x55.png 55w, /imgs/2015/11/torguad-panel-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
    <p>If you connect to the VPN service, you will have the option to select any server based on need or location from a drop down box. You can use the VPN software on up to five devices simultaneously with unlimited bandwidth on a single account. You can secure all your household devices, including your mobile devices and desktop computers.</p>
    <p>The company supports P2P and torrent traffic on every one of its servers, except the ones in New Zealand, US and UK. TorGuard has a variety of exceptional features. If you want to use L2TP/IPSec or PPTP, TorGuard provides comprehensive instructions on how to configure the built-in client of the operating system.</p>
    <p>If you prefer to use OpenVPN (the most private and secure), there are detailed instructions on configuring with Viscosity. Viscosity is an OpenVPN client that provides detailed statistics about your connection times and reliable connectivity. Viscosity is available for Windows, Mac OS X 10.5 or newer and XP SP3 or newer.</p>
    <p>With Viscosity you get a few extra features, for instance a great status graph and IPv6 leak protection.</p>
    <p>If you do not want to use Viscosity and you’d like to have an installer file that you download and started using, you can quickly download a custom build dialer app, known as TorGuard Lite. TorGuard Lite provides OpenVPN connectivity with shared server lists. It is available for all platforms not including Boxee and iOS. TorGuard Pro is a modified version of Viscosity, while TorGuard Lite is an installer file.</p>
    <p>TorGuard has an amazingly simple look, dedicated IP addresses, various server lists and easy-to-follow useful articles.</p>
    <p><strong>Security:</strong></p>
    <p>Security features with TorGuard are very impressive.</p>
    <p>TorGuard comes with a kill switch, which is important for protecting your browsing identity and data if your VPN connection ever disconnects. Without a kill switch in position, you would be left identifiable and exposed if your VPN software ever disconnects.</p>
    <p>This service also uses various tunneling protocols, including PPTP, SSTP, Ikev2, L2TP/IPsec and OpenVPN for the connection on Mac Linux, Windows, iOS, OS X and Android. You can also use system routers that run the open-source DD-WRT software, and also Boxee Box. The 256-bit OpenVPN encryption is actually the best in terms of security to any user. TorGuard also uses 256-bit encryption and TSL tunneling.</p>
    <p>Using firewall rules, the proxy service can quickly prevent spam and respond to DMCA takedown request by quickly blocking the source of abuse on a server protocol. It can stop violations very quickly and effectively within 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Apart from secure BitTorrent and VPN services, TorGuard also provides anonymous email service. We all know how essential email security can be for both businesses and individuals. Emails are the top and major targets of hackers, and the company enables you to keep them safe using log-free offshore email storage, secure G/PGP Encryption, bulk POP3 email input and MITM protection.</p>
    <p>You no longer have to worry about any sensitive information being exposed. Though they have off-shore operations to collect customers’ personal information on registration, it’s understood that it is kept for marketing reasons and up selling advertisements to customers. It’s hard to beat their first rate protection</p>
    <p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
    <p>There is no need to opt for a proxy service if the company does not guarantee customer privacy protection. TorGuard <strong>prioritizes the privacy and security of the customers’ personal information</strong> above everything else.</p>
    <p>TorGuard does not store traffic or logs from its web proxy or virtual private network. Though, their privacy policy states they use cookies and collect information on how you use their website while you are on the site. The company also says that it may use your personal information to contact regarding promotional services and may also share your details with its business partners and affiliates. This is rather disappointing since the main goal for using a VPN is to stay anonymous when browsing and keep your details secure.</p>
    <p>For BitTorrent users, the VPN provides anonymous torrent proxy and private IP address for safe sharing of documents. For VPN plan users, the company <strong>makes use of 256-bit encryption techniques</strong> and <strong>DNS leak protection </strong>and provides absolute safety to all users.</p>

    <p><strong>Speed</strong></p>
    <p>Speed is very important for any peer-2-peer devotee. Simply changing an IP address is not enough to stop tracking networks from tracking you. Not many options are given though, far as testing servers online is concerned. To measure its speed, you can run the speed tests options available on sites such as http://SpeedTest.net to measure upload and download speeds when connecting to different regions.</p>
    <p>Some locations will have blazing fast speeds, for instance the United States, and others will have fast speeds. You are able to surf the Web and even view videos online. TorGuard has no bandwidth restrictions; hence you can stream Netflix and also download torrents.</p>
    <p><strong>Usability</strong></p>
    <p>The software app you download to use the Virtual Private Network is simple to set up and very easy to use. You just select the server location from the drop down box and then the protocol and then connect, it’s that simple.</p>

    <p><strong>Pricing And Checkout</strong></p>
    <p>TorGuard has four packages to choose from.</p>
    <p><a href="https://torguard.net/aff.php?aff=1562" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12136" src="/imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Packages.png" alt="TorGuard-Packages" width="1804" height="670" srcset="/imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Packages.png 1804w, /imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Packages-300x111.png 300w, /imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Packages-1024x380.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1804px) 100vw, 1804px" /></a></p>
    <p>If you are reading this review then you are most probably accessing the Deep Web and searching Darknet Markets. For this reason you should NOT buy the “Anonymous Proxy” as it does not include a VPN therefore it will not give you the encryption and privacy you need, you need to take the VPN Pro Package or the Privacy Bundle as it has the VPN in the package and will give you maximum anonymity and privacy.</p>
    <p><a href="https://torguard.net/aff.php?aff=1562" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>&gt;&gt; Click HERE to Visit the TorGuard Official Site</strong></a></p>
    <p>The shopping process is not just about clicking on a &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; button on the appropriate plan. Then you select if you want to pay monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually or biannually. If you pay annually or biannually then you will get a massive discount and halve the cost per month.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12132" src="/imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Checkout.png" alt="TorGuard Checkout" width="946" height="623" srcset="/imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Checkout.png 1790w, /imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Checkout-300x198.png 300w, /imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Checkout-1024x674.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px" /></p>
    <p>The website asks you to specify how many devices you want included to your plan. As earlier stated, TorGuard allows you to use up to five simultaneous devices. Every additional device comes at an extra $1 per month. So if you’re going to use five or less devices, you keep the extra cost here at zero; if you’ll have six in total, then the entered value has to be one, and so forth.</p>
    <p>Extra Viscosity licenses are available at $1 each as well, per month. You can also specify if you want to have a regular dedicated IP address for only $7.99 per month, so that every time you connect to the proxy service, you’ll always get the same IP location.</p>
    <p>TorGuard also offers anonymous email service with offshore email storage and secure web based G/PGP encryption. Users have the option of signing up for unlimited storage at $5.33 per month with quarterly billing, or as little as $4.16 per month with yearly billing. If you choose the “Privacy Bundle” then it is included in the price.</p>
    <p>You can pay anonymously using Bitcoins. In addition, you can pay using PayPal, OK Pay or credit card.</p>
    <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12137" src="/imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Payments.png" alt="TorGuard-Payments" width="786" height="103" srcset="/imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Payments.png 786w, /imgs/2015/11/TorGuard-Payments-300x39.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" /></p>
    <p><strong>Customer Support</strong></p>
    <p>Not everybody is tech savvy and sometimes we may need help. VPN technologies are mostly complicated for newbie and might want to seek help setting it up and resolving compatibility issues.</p>
    <p>TorGuard has a normal customer service system that includes ticketing system and live chat support. Although TorGuard guarantees a 24&#215;7 online support to its users through live chat and email ticketing, lots of users have expressed disappointment over lack of response when they send inquiries through their system.</p>
    <p>The company has a vast FAQ where you can find a lot of information that’s related to most of the inquiries you may have.</p>
    <p>The <strong>quick and step-by-step tutorials on their platform</strong> make users experience easier. Regardless of the company being founded in 2012, it provides what’s needed to enjoy fast, cheap and secure internet access.</p>
    <p>The Torrent and Proxy service tutorials are accessible in pdf format for offline reading and online on the TorGuard website. The tutorials cover the setup methods for major apps, browsers and devices (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Skype, Internet Explorer, Boxee Box, uTorrent, Vuze, Deluge and BitTorrent).</p>
    <p>All in all, TorGuard is quite good when compared to other paid proxy services. It offers a great selection of servers to connect to, great connectivity with different devices and most importantly excellent privacy and anonymity that you need when using the Deep Web.</p>
