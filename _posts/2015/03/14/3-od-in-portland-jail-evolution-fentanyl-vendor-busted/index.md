<p>According to a report in <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/03/three_od_on_dangerous_drug_smu.html#incart_2box">oregonlive.com</a>  (see article for full details) A 27-year-old inmate in the <a href="http://www.jailexchange.com/countyjails/oregon/multnomah/multnomah_county_detention_center.aspx">Justice Center Jail </a>is accused of smuggling a synthetic opioid many times more powerful than heroin (Fentanyl ) into the downtown Portland lockup last weekend, causing at least three of her fellow inmates to overdose &#8211; the investigation led to an evolution vendor who was arrested later:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investigators traced the source of the drugs that killed Henke to a house several hundred yards away from where he overdosed.</p>
<p>A task force of agents and police detectives armed with a warrant searched the property, finding cash, drug paraphernalia, a laptop computer and a white powder later determined to be fentanyl, according to a criminal complaint affidavit signed by <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2013/06/drug_cartels_in_oregon_rise_an.html">Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Guy Gino</a>, who works on a Portland-based drug task force.</p>
<p>Investigators interviewed Ryan Jensen, who lived in the house. Jensen admitted he bought illegal drugs on the <a href="/2013/10/28/updated-llist-of-hidden-marketplaces-tor-i2p/">Internet dark site &#8220;Evolution&#8221;</a> and logged in to the encrypted members-only site to buy 1 gram of fentanyl and 12 grams of heroin, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>Authorities accuse Jensen of selling 250 milligrams of fentanyl to two friends, including overdose victim Henke.</p>
<p>Investigators say they logged into Jensen&#8217;s Evolution account, finding that he had made six illegal purchases from the site, including a Dec. 7 shipment from a Southeast Portland man later identified as Brandon Hubbard, Channing Lacey&#8217;s boyfriend.</p>
<p>Members of the drug task force later bought <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">bitcoin</a>, a form of decentralized Internet currency, and opened an undercover account to purchase 100 milligrams of fentanyl citrate from Hubbard, listing their return address as a post office box in <a href="http://www.cityoffargo.com/">Fargo, North Dakota</a>.</p>
<p>Investigators from the Portland and Grand Forks task forces secretly tailed Hubbard, watching him use a Bitcoin kiosk in the food court of the <a href="http://www.pioneerplace.com/">Pioneer Place Mall</a> in Portland. They also uncovered records showing that Hubbard made two bitcoin exchanges in late January totaling $14,580, according to Gino&#8217;s affidavit.</p>
<p>On Jan. 21, agents tailed Hubbard&#8217;s brand new Volkswagen GTI as he drove to a Postal Annex, bought packaging items and returned to his home. They noticed that as he approached his house, he began to drive in a big circle as if to expose anyone who might be following him.</p>
<p>Later that day, agents tailed him to a U.S. postal facility near <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/travel/index.ssf/pdx-airport-flight-delays-flight-tracker.html">Portland International Airport</a> and watched him mail nine envelopes to people across the United States.</p>
<p>In the first minutes of Jan. 22, authorities raided Hubbard&#8217;s studio apartment, finding 100 grams of fentanyl citrate, scales, packaging materials, mailing envelopes and cash, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>They also arrested Hubbard, who told them he had sold more than 400 grams of fentanyl on Internet dark sites, authorities say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hubbard admitted that in November 2014, he purchased approximately 750 grams of fentanyl citrate for purposes of further distribution and that the &#8216;street value&#8217; of the 750 grams of fentanyl citrate was approximately $1.5 million,&#8221; according to Gino&#8217;s affidavit. &#8220;Hubbard also said he knew that fentanyl citrate was an extremely powerful narcotic and that it could easily cause an overdose and kill someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told investigators that throughout 2014, he dealt with a Canadian supplier as part of a large-scale operation to distribute the drug, court papers allege. Sometime around Thanksgiving last year, he received a <a href="http://local.fedex.com/or/portland/office-5128/?cmp=LOC-1001545-3-1-971-1110000-US-US-EN-FEDPACKPLUS5128">FedEx</a> package from China &#8212; through a friend&#8217;s company in Woodland, Washington &#8212; that contained 250 grams of fentanyl, according to the documents.</p>
<p>While Hubbard sat in jail, Lacey dug up a stash of fentanyl buried outside her boyfriend&#8217;s apartment in Southeast Portland, court papers show.</p>
<p>When authorities arrested Lacey on March 5, she told them she had overdosed on fentanyl multiple times, according to a government court paper intended to keep her in jail as she awaits trial.</p>
<p>What Lacey didn&#8217;t tell authorities, the government alleges, is that she had hidden a bag of fentanyl inside her body.</p>
<p>Corrections officers don&#8217;t conduct searches of inmates&#8217; body cavities without a court order. So when she was placed in the women&#8217;s unit on the eighth floor of the Justice Center Jail, she was able to pull out the drugs and distribute them, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Before her first court appearance on March 6, Lacey distributed the fentanyl to a fellow inmate, telling her it was <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2010/09/prosecutors_book_illustrates_h.html">&#8220;China White&#8221; heroin</a>. The drug was soon subdivided inside the walls of the women&#8217;s unit.</p>
<p>The first overdose occurred last Saturday, followed by another on Sunday and another on Monday, according to <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/01/report_suicide_watch_at_multno.html">Lt. Steve Alexander, a spokesman for the Multnomah County Sheriff&#8217;s Office</a>, which operates the jail. One by one, he said, they were transported by ambulance to the emergency room at Oregon Health &amp; Science University.</p>
<p>Detectives with the sheriff&#8217;s Special Investigations Unit brought in drug sniffing dogs as authorities shook down the women&#8217;s jail, which holds about 200 inmates. They searched the dorm and flipped cells to find the remaining fentanyl, repeating their work as a precautionary measure at the <a href="http://www3.multco.us/countyproperties/BuildingGeneralInformation.aspx?bldgnbr=314">Inverness Jail</a> on the north end of Portland.</p>
<p>No one died in the overdoses. The inmates are all back in custody. But the investigation continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a never ending battle to keep the drugs out,&#8221; Alexander said, &#8220;and there are a variety of ways people arrested bring them in.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
