<p>There was a man who did the unspoken<br />
    He looked for freedom from the violence<br />
    No one is perfect, when there’s new ground broken<br />
    A mess is made, and someone gets blamed</p>
<p>He had a dream of harmony<br />
    As you wish to live out your own<br />
    We cannot stand for this<br />
    Cannot have you fall<br />
    Along the silk road</p>
<p>This ain’t the movies, there’s a war in the streets<br />
    The innocent are in jail<br />
    We pray for justice and we wanna be free<br />
    And hope the truth will prevail</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>We still have hope<br />
    We cannot quit<br />
    Don’t be afraid</p>
<p>We have a voice<br />
    And this is it<br />
    Let the light show the way</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>#3 &#8211; I Am Dread Pirate Roberts (RAP) LankyB AKA John Bush<br />
</strong></span>This one just came up on my twitter today:</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/189563415&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></p>
<p>Lyrics:</p>
<p>I am Silk Road<br />
    I am the Market<br />
    I am the Person<br />
    I am the Enterprise<br />
    I am the Everything</p>
<p>I am Dread Pirate Roberts<br />
    I am Dread Pirate Roberts<br />
    I am Dread Pirate Roberts</p>
<p>I own my body I know I am free<br />
    No master or tyrant has control over me<br />
    I am responsible for the whole of my actions<br />
    Whether they bring joy, guilt, or dissatisfaction</p>
<p>I am encryption,<br />
    I2P and TOR<br />
    I’m a hidden service<br />
    behind closed doors</p>
<p>I am Bitcoin I am peer to peer<br />
    theres no one to arrest so i live with no fear</p>
<p>I am Silk Road<br />
    I am the Market<br />
    I am the Person<br />
    I am the Enterprise<br />
    I am the Everything</p>
<p>I am Dread Pirate Roberts<br />
    I am Dread Pirate Roberts<br />
    I am Dread Pirate Roberts</p>
<p>Im atlantis agora and Open Bazaar<br />
    You can shut one down, but the others aren’t far<br />
    the Dark Net is rising like a shooting star<br />
    We all hold the keys to my black market car</p>
<p>I am everywhere at once yet nowhere to be seen<br />
    In your heart, in your mind, in your hard drive and screen<br />
    I am you, you are me, and together we’ll flee<br />
    I built the road and path that you need to be free</p>
<p>I am the savior of sovereignty, Menace to monopoly<br />
    Preserver of privacy, and there just aint no stoppin me<br />
    I enable enigma, agorist with no stigma<br />
    I’ll root out the mole that inhabits your soul</p>
<p>I am an idea whose time has come<br />
    an idea so strong it puts states on the run<br />
    no agent can stop me, no attorney or judge<br />
    I will be here forever with eternal love</p>
<p>I am Silk Road<br />
    I am the Market<br />
    I am the Person<br />
    I am the Enterprise<br />
    I am the Everything</p>
<p>I am Dread Pirate Roberts<br />
    I am Dread Pirate Roberts<br />
    I am Dread Pirate Roberts</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4# &#8211; For Ross<br />
</strong></span>This one was shared with me after posting the previous one on Reddit, in the words of its creator: &#8221; It&#8217;s abstract enough that it could be about anything, but I was thinking about one person when it was written.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;Great Plains,&#8221; meant to infer higher plains of knowledge and discovery,<br />
    when I say &#8220;we&#8221; I mean Ross and the overlapping lives that have intersected the path he&#8217;s created,<br />
    when I say &#8220;tears&#8221; I&#8217;m thinking of his parents,<br />
    when I say &#8220;spark,&#8221; I mean opening the channels of inquiry into consciousness development &#8211; daring to forge your own path,<br />
    when I say &#8220;what do we know&#8221; I&#8217;m thinking of Socrates drinking the hemlock, Turing and the poison apple,<br />
    when I say &#8220;unfurling&#8221; I&#8217;m thinking of people like the person who called Ross a hero as he was convicted.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lyrics</span>:</p>
<p>Along we knew the path would wind<br />
    Dawn beneath the candle burning<br />
    Songs of tears that wipe away with time</p>
<p>Alone we knew one path one mind<br />
    Called to breach the shadows lurking<br />
    Words of tears that sting one day will dry</p>
<p>Along we knew our paths combine<br />
    Spark release the channels flooding<br />
    Minds relay one hand one sail away</p>
<p>What do we think<br />
    What do we know<br />
    Where is it from<br />
    Where does it go</p>
<p>Along we knew the path would wind<br />
    Thoughts unfelt unreeled unfurling<br />
    High for you to see to be and hear</p>
<p>Alone we too can stand in time<br />
    Thoughtlessly but full of reason<br />
    Try to say these words we can&#8217;t define</p>
<p>Why do we feel<br />
    What is it for<br />
    Signal too weak<br />
    Effort too slow</p>
<p>Along we flew the peril of mind<br />
    Saw unseen unwondered senseless<br />
    Thoughts that keep us down<br />
    One day will rise</p>
<p>One day we&#8217;ll rise</p>
