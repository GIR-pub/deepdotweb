<p>Just announced on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2wdiqs/psaarticlethe_deep_webb_darknet_version_of_reddit/" target="_blank">the clearnet version</a> of Reddit:</p>
<blockquote><p>I welcome the beta version of the darknet of reddit or the deep web.</p>
<p><a href="http://2c7lhc5tai5a3wdd.onion" target="_blank">http://2c7lhc5tai5a3wdd.onion</a></p>
<p>You can call it the front page of the deep web. The site functions just like reddit but more taboo subjects. Go ahead and create subreddits and lets see what happens. As it&#8217;s in beta, some functions arn&#8217;t working but the veterans of reddit will know how to get around and populate when the search functions are working &amp; wiki.</p>
<p>PLEASE DO NOT USE SAME PASSWORD AS REDDIT &amp; MARKET ACCOUNTS.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not the first time that a reddit clone is being launched as an onion site, will keep following and see how this develops. Hopefully it will be kept clean.</p>
