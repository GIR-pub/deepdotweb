<p><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/melbourne-hurtcore-paedophile-master-matthew-graham-pleads-guilty-20150908-gjht6d.html">Matthew David Graham, A.K.A. Lux, has pleaded guilty to 13 child porn-related charges</a>. The 22-year-old man residing in Melbourne was not only a babysitter for young children, but he was running a big CP ring on the darknet under the username of Lux. The website he was running was specialized in hurtcore porn, which means that the children, babies and toddlers on the CP website were not only abused, but they were also physically tortured or harmed. This genre of child porn is even disapproved by a specific part of the deep web CP community.</p>
<p>”This material was the worst of the worst in the world,&#8221; a Victoria police investigator who was involved in the case stated.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/how-matthew-david-grahams-hurtcore-paedophile-habit-began-on-the-dark-web-20150908-gjhz43.html">The Australian newspaper, theage.au has made a report about Graham how he got into child porn</a>. According to them, he hasn’t done any illegal activity regarding child porn until he was 18. At that time, he was a massive player of World of Warcraft and a usual reader of 4chan. When the hacker group, Anonymous has made a post on 4chan that they are planning to launch a massive cyber attack on the pedo site Lolita City, he has made his first move. He became curious and has learned how to use the Tor browser and other deep web related stuff that helps to hide a person’s identity from the law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>Later on, when he has finished high school, he has attended La Trobe University majoring in nanotechnology, that was the time when he set up his ”career” as the ”king of a darknet child porn website”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/06/24/large-number-of-child-abuse-sites-shut-down-abruptly/">However, his so-called ”career” has ended when he has decided to shut down the whole website of his in June 2014</a>. Lux has posted an official announcement on the hurtcore CP website as a farewell message:</p>
<blockquote><p>” As always, all Empires eventually fall and today is the day that the {Removed} falls.</p>
<p>After years of running CP hidden services, today is the day that I walk away. There are personal issues which my close friends have been made aware of that have forced me to make this decision.</p>
<p>I will leave {Removed} (and it’s chat) as well as {Removed} up for the time being however if I host for you via {Removed} I suggest you start looking for a new hosting provider ASAP.</p>
<p>I don’t like long awkward farewells, so… Goodbye :)</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Lux.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Although, he has stopped all child porn activity, he has been arrested after a joint investigation by the FBI, Australian Federal Police, Victoria Police&#8217;s Taskforce Astraea, Canadian police, and Europol. After they have taken Graham (22) down, he pleaded guilty to 13 charges regarding child porn.</p>
<p>The LE authorities have not only busted Lux, but they have also successfully linked the pedophile kingpin to other abductors, such as Peter Gerard Scully, a Melbourne man who is facing his charges on human trafficking, rape and murder in the Philippines. According to Australian investigators, Graham and Scully have shared a child porn video, called ”Daisy’s Destruction” where an Asian child was abused and tortured by two adults.</p>
<p>More importantly, another deep web CP website admin has been linked to Lux and has been caught by LE, Shannon Grant McCoole (33), A.K.A. Skee. He was a former childcare worker who has been charged with sexually abusing seven children in his care and running a darknet child porn site. Graham was charged with supplying CP material to Skee’s website. McCole has been jailed for 35 years of prison, however, at the moment, he is appealing his sentence.</p>
<p>A 27-year old, now jailed, Cranbourne man was also linked to Graham. We don’t know his name since he requested the media to suppress his name. According to LE, Graham allegedly helped the Cranbourne man to secure himself and evade detection after the convict has made child pornography with a relative of his aged between six and nine and was under his care in the years of 2010 to 2014. One of the images that have been made by the Cranbourne man was with the girl in 2014 holding a sign ”Lux” written on it.</p>
<p>Matthew David Graham’s case comes to the County Court for sentencing on February 3.</p>
