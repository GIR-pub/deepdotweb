<p>The 29-year-old who was arrested Saturday afternoon is suspected of operating as  a large scale vendor of medical drugs (Lifestyle-Apotheke, Lifestyle-Pharmacy).</p>
<p>According to the Prosecutor Verden an der Aller (Lower Saxony) in charge of  the Lower Saxony Internet crime unit. Police was working on the case for the past few months.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have researched in the clear and Darknet,&#8221; said Attorney Lutz Gaebel. After all, you&#8217;ve figured out the vendor name of the man: &#8220;<strong>OxyWhite</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Under this pseudonym he had offered medicines and drugs. A packaging station near the Bonn University Hospital is said to have played a major role in his drug operation.</p>
<p>Friday night police conducted a search escorted by a special riot police in two apartments in St. Augustin and the work of the man in the Bonn University Clinic.</p>
