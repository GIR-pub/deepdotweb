After selecting the listing and quantity that you want, you can select a specific Bitcoin public key, or you can let the market select a random public key from your own pool.

<h3>Some important notes about ordering:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do your research, check reviews for both listings and vendors before placing an order.</li>
<li>Check that you have enough funds available to make a purchase.</li>
<li>Use <a href="/?s=PGP" target="_blank">GPG encryption</a> when communicating sensitive information by manually encrypting your message, or you can let market do that for you.</li>
<li>It is recommended, but not mandatory that you make a copy of &#8220;Redeem script&#8221; and store it securely after you create an order to ensure that you can claim or refund your funds in case market is unavailable. &#8220;Reedem script&#8221; is available under &#8220;Multisig details&#8221; tab. Once order is finalized/cancelled and claimed/refunded, you can delete backup of &#8220;Redeem script&#8221;.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have your corresponding Bitcoin private key stored securely in case of refund.</li>
<li>Prior to finalizing an order, make sure that everything is ok with your shipment.</li>
<li>Depending on the listing type, (I.e physical or digital,) the order will autofinalize after a certain amount of time. For physical items, autofinalization period is 21 days and digital 3 days.</li>
<li>In case your vendor doesn&#8217;t process your order, autocancelation will occur after 3 days and your funds will became available for a refund.</li>
<li>Make sure to have a valid reason for dispute. Disputes can be solved with vendor directly. If you and the vendor can&#8217;t come to resolution, both parties can then escalate the problem and ask for market support by filling a new ticket. To create new ticket go to the, &#8220;Profile&#8221; menu and select the &#8220;Tickets&#8221; option. Select &#8220;New ticket&#8221; to start filling the dispute. Be sure to explain your problem in detail to assist market staff in resolving the dispute.</li>
