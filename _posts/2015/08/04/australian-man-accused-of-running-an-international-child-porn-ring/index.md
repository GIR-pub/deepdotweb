<p>There have been quite some events regarding child pornography. If you can remember, there was a case when the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/07/us-usa-crime-childporn-idUSKCN0PH24C20150707">FBI has busted a large CP website that had around 215.000 users</a>. Also, there has been a pretty weird case on a child pornography domain where the <a href="https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/07/16/pedophiles-launch-dash-darkcoin-mining-crowdfunding-platform/">site admin has set up a system (crowdfunding platform) that allows members to mine Darkcoins in order to pay for the content</a>.</p>
<p>However, the latest news around pedophiles has been an <a href="http://qntra.net/2015/08/australian-faces-88-charges-related-to-darknet-child-pornography-sites/">Australian man, named Matthew David Graham, who has been accused of 88 charges</a>, including the running and being the kingpin of an international child pornography. The CP ring included 12 websites that contained child pornography. He was also charged with giving advice on abducting, raping and killing a five-year-old girl in Russia.</p>
<p>Graham has been also accused with the charge of by helping a man in Melbourne abusing a young girl. He helped the child abductor by providing a hand in concealing the pedophile’s identity. When the police have asked about the login details and password of the Melbourne man, Graham refused to provide these details to the law enforcement authorities. The latter event happened last year.</p>
<p>Matthew David Graham has been a student in the La Trobe University where he was studying nanotechnology. He is 22 years old.</p>
<p>The CP ring has been operated at the house of Graham’s parents in South Morang. The material found by the police has contained images of children as young as three being used and kept as sex slaves.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Graham has attended his court trial with his lawyer where he only said the sentence “Thank you, Your Honour” and left alongside with the security guard who was escorting him back to custody.</p>
<p>Matthew David Graham has been first arrested last year in a joint operation by the Victorian Police and the FBI. We don’t know much information about last year’s events since the judge has ordered a suppression order on the case. What we know is that the FBI has helped finding the kingpin of the international CP ring by a newly developed &#8220;Network Investigative Technique&#8221;, which included the operation of multiple child pornography websites that have contained malware and other kinds of exploits that could identify the members and users of these domains.</p>
<p>The FBI affidavit states:</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>
<blockquote><p>”Accordingly, on February 20, 2015, the same date Website A was seized, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia authorized a search warrant to allow law enforcement agents to deploy at Network Investigative Technique (&#8220;NIT&#8221;) on Website A in an attempt to identify the actual IP addresses and other identifying information of computers used to access Website A.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="22">
<li>
<blockquote><p>”Pursuant to that authorization, on or about and between February 20, 2015, and March 4, 2015, each time any user or administrator logged into Website A by entering a username and password, the FBI was authorized to deploy the NIT which would send one or more communications to the user&#8217;s computer. Those communications were designed to cause the receiving computer to deliver to a computer known to or controlled by the government data that would help identify the computer, its location, other information about the computer, and the user of the computer accessing Website A. That data included: the computer&#8217;s actual IP address, and the date and time that the NIT determined what that IP address was; a unique identifier generated by the NIT (e.g., a series of numbers, letters and/or special characters) to distinguish the data from that of other computers; the type of operating system running on the computer, including type (e.g., Windows), version (e.g., Windows 7), and architecture (e.g., x86); information about whether the NIT had already been delivered to the computer; the computer&#8217;s Host Name; the computer&#8217;s active operating system username; and the computer&#8217;s MAC address. ”</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Matthew David Graham case has greatly affected the laws of Victoria State. <a href="http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/3255387/victoria-to-double-online-sex-fiend-jail-terms-introduce-new-laws-to-combat-child-porn/?cs=7">The Victorian Government has decided to double the prison terms for accessing child pornography</a>. They have also set up offense categories. There will be three new categories: administering a child pornography website, encouraging the use of a website to deal with child pornography, providing assistance to another person about avoiding apprehension for a child pornography offense. These changes in Victorian Law will try to discourage people from watching or possessing child pornography.</p>
<p>The Graham case continues and returns to court on August 25.</p>
