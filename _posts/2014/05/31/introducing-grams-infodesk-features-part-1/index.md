    <p>Following our previous report about <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/grams-search-darknet-marketplaces/">Grams</a> search engine <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/05/17/a-sneak-peek-to-grams-search-engine-stage-2-infodesk/">new features</a> &#8211; We are happy to release the &#8220;2 parts&#8221; announcement about their new features, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the first part here</span> is directed at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>users</strong></span> using the infodesk system and the second part will be for vendors &amp; The &#8220;gramwords&#8221; (Advertising system for promoting listing on grams search results working in a similar way to Google&#8217;s Adword&#8217;s system).</p>

    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Infodesk for Visitors users that have no-grams account</strong></span></p>
    <p>As the Grams admin told us:</p>
    <blockquote><p>The InfoDesk is a collection of vendor identities. A vendor identity page displays all the information on a vendor from their different market accounts linked by pgp key. Visitors can search the InfoDesk directly or get linked directly to a vendor identity page from Grams search results. The information these pages have are invaluable to making buying decisions and stopping scammers.</p></blockquote>

    <li>Some of the emails the vendors use for their keys are fake, but they pretty obvious to spot, for example – this fake email address from one key:<a href="/imgs/2014/05/g3q34.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5825" src="/imgs/2014/05/g3q34.png" alt="g3q34" width="335" height="153" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/g3q34.png 335w, /imgs/2014/05/g3q34-300x137.png 300w, /imgs/2014/05/g3q34-272x125.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /></a></li>

    <p><a href="/imgs/2014/05/t26tz.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5830" src="/imgs/2014/05/t26tz.png" alt="t26tz" width="289" height="629" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/t26tz.png 1101w, /imgs/2014/05/t26tz-138x300.png 138w, /imgs/2014/05/t26tz-471x1024.png 471w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /></a>This is provided with the hope that all this information will make it easier for people to spot and avoid scammers.</p>
    <p>As the Grams admin added:</p>
    <blockquote><p>Not all vendors have a profile page though. Grams is only scraping 6 markets right now for pgp keys – <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/agora-market">Agora</a>, <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/silk-road-2-0">Silkroad2</a>, <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/evolution-marketplace">Evolution</a> , <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/pandora-market">Pandora</a>, <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/black-bank-bitcoin-market">Black Bank</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/listing/cloud-9">Cloud9</a> So only vendors in those markets will have profile pages. I will be adding the other markets soon. I picked those 4 to do first because they had the most listings so would cover the most vendors. the same thing applies for reviews but Grams is only scraping agora and silkroad for the same reason. I am working on adding Evolution reviews as we speak. I have updated the market widget on sidebar to show which markets what information I get from which markets ,along with their online status.</p></blockquote>

    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Features for Grams&#8217; user accounts</span></strong></p>
    <p>To get a user account on grams you must have:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A pgp key which will the user will have to verify upon registering.</li>
    <li>.01 btc as an entry fee. Grams charges this to help deter fake accounts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As the Admin explained:</p>
    <blockquote><p>I want the Reviews on grams to matter and not to be faked. They will reflect an overall rating of a vendor and help give useful information to help buyers avoid scammers, which are a plague on tor. Your entry fee will be credited to your Grams balance so you can use it for grams services. The only grams service right now is <strong>Grams Words</strong> but I have plans for at least 3 more which will on the way soon.</p>
    <p>User registration will be invite only for a little while, mainly to work out bugs and get the best quality reviews on Grams first. I will be giving out invites to trusted people and also posting some invite links in the forums and on reddit every day. This will only last a couple of weeks at the most and then Grams will be open registration.</p></blockquote>
    <p>Registration is easy. Just fill in username, password and pgpkey:</p>
    <div id="attachment_5807" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/imgs/2014/05/signuppage.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5807" class="wp-image-5807" src="/imgs/2014/05/signuppage.png" alt="signuppage" width="400" height="322" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/signuppage.png 1300w, /imgs/2014/05/signuppage-300x242.png 300w, /imgs/2014/05/signuppage-1024x825.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5807" class="wp-caption-text">Registration</p></div>
    <p>The next page will give you an btc address to pay the entry fee. <strong>The system doesn&#8217;t keep any bitcoins or bitcoin client on the server</strong>. Instead it checks the bitcoin address transactions every 15 minutes. Users can refresh the page as they wait and see the confirmations come in. Only 3 confirmations are needed. After the payment is verified users will get a pgp verification message which they need to decode to verify they own the pgp key they signed up with. Once verified they will be able to access all the Grams features. Also when verifying the pgp it will check it against any know vendor pgp key ,if there is a matches it will link the vendor profile page to the user account. More about that in part 2.</p>
    <div id="attachment_5808" style="width: 517px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/imgs/2014/05/testpayentry.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5808" class=" wp-image-5808" src="/imgs/2014/05/testpayentry.png" alt="New user payment" width="507" height="366" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/testpayentry.png 1119w, /imgs/2014/05/testpayentry-300x217.png 300w, /imgs/2014/05/testpayentry-1024x739.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5808" class="wp-caption-text">New user payment</p></div>
    <div id="attachment_5811" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/imgs/2014/05/verifypgp.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5811" class=" wp-image-5811" src="/imgs/2014/05/verifypgp.png" alt="Verify PGP " width="512" height="431" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/verifypgp.png 831w, /imgs/2014/05/verifypgp-300x253.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5811" class="wp-caption-text">Verify PGP</p></div>
    <p><strong>Users features </strong></p>
    <p>Once logged in, a user has access to some important features, such as:</p>
    <p><strong>Messaging</strong> &#8211; They can send message to any grams user and more importantly &#8211; to any vendor(who is also a grams user) through the InfoDesk. This means if a market goes down a buyer can still contact their vendor. All message are pgp encrypted on the server and stored that way. Since every user must verify their PGP it makes it easy to know the recipient will be able to read the message they get. and the admin added:</p>
    <blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t expect you to trust me to encrypt it though. Users can pgp encrypt the message themselves and the system won&#8217;t double encrypt it.</p></blockquote>
    <p>If you go to the send message page from a link such as the &#8220;message&#8221; button on an InfoDesk profile page or the &#8220;message admin&#8221; button the user&#8217;s pgp key will be at the bottom of the page. If a users composes a message from scratch then they can type in the username of the person they intend to send to and click the verify user button. It will check to make sure it is a correct Grams username and return their pgp key.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5795" src="/imgs/2014/05/pgpbutton.png" alt="pgpbutton" width="686" height="629" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/pgpbutton.png 686w, /imgs/2014/05/pgpbutton-300x275.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></p>

    <p><strong>Reviews</strong> &#8211; Users can review any of the vendors from the infodesk at anytime. They can also edit their reviews at anytime. The reviews are consist of a 1 to 5 star rating and also a short comment. The top vendors are displayed on the InfoDesk page. Their ranking is based on star rating and number of Grams reviews. Later, an option to rate any .onion site will be added as well.<a href="/imgs/2014/05/infodeskloggedin.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5798" src="/imgs/2014/05/infodeskloggedin.png" alt="infodeskloggedin" width="578" height="392" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/infodeskloggedin.png 909w, /imgs/2014/05/infodeskloggedin-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></a></p>
    <div id="attachment_5812" style="width: 438px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/imgs/2014/05/reviewsample.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5812" class=" wp-image-5812" src="/imgs/2014/05/reviewsample.png" alt="Review vendor" width="428" height="277" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/reviewsample.png 846w, /imgs/2014/05/reviewsample-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5812" class="wp-caption-text">Review vendor</p></div>
    <p><strong>Grams Words (which will be discussed further in the next post) </strong>&#8211; Even if a user&#8217;s pgp did not get linked with a vendor account they can still use Grams Words to advertise on grams through keywords searches. It is listed under the services section. Grams Words is a little more complex and will be explain in part 2 of this article.</p>
    <p><a href="/imgs/2014/05/gramswordsdash.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5814" src="/imgs/2014/05/gramswordsdash.png" alt="gramswordsdash" width="477" height="250" srcset="/imgs/2014/05/gramswordsdash.png 938w, /imgs/2014/05/gramswordsdash-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></a></p>
    <p>We can sum up that exactly like we anticipated Gram is becoming the most exciting feature on the deep web and is proving to be a major leap forward for the way people will conduct their business and attract new audience to the various marketplaces. part 2 of this article will be dedicated to the vendor side of the system and the Most exciting gramwords advertising dashboard.</p>
