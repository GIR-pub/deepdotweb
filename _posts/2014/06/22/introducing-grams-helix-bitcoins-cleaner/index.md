    <p>Helix is the definitive darknet bitcoin cleaner. Grams&#8217; helix doesn&#8217;t just clean your bitcoins it gives you brand new ones which have never been to the darknet before. The helix system is more than a bitcoin tumbler, it is privacy and security wrapped in one.</p>

    <p><strong>How is it different?</strong><br />
    The Helix process uses a new proprietary technology which has never been used before with bitcoin tumbling. The coins are not just mixed but traded out for new ones before mixing. I can&#8217;t go into specifics for security reasons, but I can assure you the helix system will sever the blockchain taint and by giving you new coins which have not been through <a href="http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/04/08/grams-darknetmarkets-search-engine/">grams</a> or the darknet. I have been using this systems for all the bitcoins that have come in to grams since the beginning. After seeing shared coin go down I figured I should make it public.</p>
    <p>Grams has been using this system for a while on the back-end. Every bitcoin loaded in a Grams account starts the process as soon as it arrives. This we we build up a reserve of clean bitcoins which are ready on demand for smaller orders. The helix process has a maximum process time of 4 hours. So even without reserves you will start receiving your bitcoins in a timely manner.</p>

    <p><strong>How to use?</strong><br />
    Helix is easy to use since it is integrated in to your normal Grams&#8217; account. Load bitcoins in to your account as you normally do. You will find a Helix withdraw form on your account bitcoin page. Once you put in the amount you wish to withdraw and the address to send to the system with start the process and use the coins already in your Grams&#8217; account.</p>
    <p><strong>Numbers</strong><br />
    -Fee is 3%<br />
    -Minimum withdrawal is .02 BTC<br />
    -Maximum withdrawal is 1 BTC (for now)<br />
    -Time 3-4 hours</p>
    <p>There is a .01 btc entry fee to create a Grams&#8217; account (which is applied towards your balance). So if you don&#8217;t have a Gram&#8217;s account and are creating one to use helix. You can load your account after your entry fee clears 3 confirmations, or when sending the entry-fee send more than .02 btc and it will all be applied to your Grams&#8217; balance.</p>
    <p><strong>Time</strong><br />
    You can set a delay (and it is recommended).<br />
    Once the delay is over the helix process will take less than 4 hours.<br />
    If there is enough reserve built up you will be paid from the already cleaned coins and the process will be much faster.</p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong><br />
    Helix has it&#8217;s own server not connected to Grams. The several bitcoin clients it uses are on a completely separate server from Helix and Grams. Even if Grams was under attack or compromised it would not affect the Helix system.</p>
    <p><strong>Privacy</strong><br />
    All logs are deleted after 7 days, but you can deleted the logs off the server manually after the helix withdraw is complete. Once all transactions have been sent for a helix withdraw you will receive an encrypted message on Grams with the transactions hashes as a receipt of payment. The message will auto-delete after it has been read. The bitcoin clients are also switched out regularly.</p>
    <p><strong>Paper Insured</strong><br />
    Grams is built upon trust and brings that trust to Helix.<br />
    Every night half of all the profits made for that day will be deposited into a btc address which is a paper address, I have the only copy of the private key and it has never seen the internet. Grams will keep depositing in to it until it reaches an amount equal to or greater than the average daily volume of Helix. This is to insure your money. In the highly unlikely case the severs got hacked or compromised Grams could use this reserve to pay back anyone who had their money stolen or lost. After a week or so of build up I will post the public address so all users to verify that money is getting deposited every night (and no withdraws are made).</p>
    <p>It was added by Grams admin that:</p>
    <blockquote><p>This step is truly unnecessary since Grams is very security conscious, but it is a step I am willing to take to earn the trust of all of you.</p></blockquote>
