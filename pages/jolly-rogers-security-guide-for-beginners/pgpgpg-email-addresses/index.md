<p>Over the time I&#8217;ve been here I&#8217;ve been talking to a lot of people. I have also acquired a lot of gpg/pgp keys and I see that LOT of people use there real email addresses. I would like to remind everyone that when you give someone your pgp/gpg key <em><strong>THEY CAN SEE THE EMAIL ADDRESS THAT YOU ASSOCIATED WITH THAT KEY</strong></em>. You are <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> suppose to use <strong><em>ANY</em></strong> type of clearnet email service such as: gmail, yahoo, hotmail, etc. If you want to use a valid email address then you need to use an email provider that supports Tor and anonymity. For example I use safe-mail. I&#8217;m able to access this email service on Tor which allows me to stay anonymous. You may also use an email such as &#8220;123@123.com&#8221;.</p>
<p><em><strong>DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATE A CLEAR NET EMAIL ADDRESS WITH YOUR PGP/GPG KEY. THIS WILL COMPROMISE YOUR ANONYMITY.</strong></em></p>
<p>Definition of DOX: Personal information about people on the Internet, often including real name, known aliases, address, phone number, SSN, credit card number, etc.</p>
